The Herald LONDON. — The gruelling schedule for the English Premier League football’s top clubs is taking its toll but that is leaving the title race wide open ahead of last night’s top-of-the-table clash. Leaders Tottenham Hotspur travelled to second-placed champions Liverpool last night with both sides on 25 points. But eight teams are within five points of the pair as the usual breakaway of title contenders at the top fails to emerge. Chelsea, whose early season form suggested they could be in the thick of the battle, lost 2-1 at 10th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers on Tuesday night — meaning back-to-back defeats for Frank Lampard’s team who lost at Everton on Saturday. Manchester City, who drew in their local derby at United on Saturday, were left frustrated after being held to a 1-1 draw at home to 19th placed West Bromwhich Albion. Chelsea and City were in Champions League action last week before domestic fixtures on Saturday and then a quick turnaround for Tuesday night’s games and Lampard said he felt tiredness had been a factor in his team’s lacklustre second-half display. “There could be some fatigue,” said Lampard, whose side have already played five games in 15 days this month. “I hate to say it after a defeat because it feels like an excuse but even in the first 60 minutes when we were the better team, we didn’t have a zip about us. “We’ve travelled up to Everton, came back and then travelled to Wolves but everyone is in the same boat. We have a couple of injuries in areas which means I can’t make too many changes so I understand that side of it,” he added. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said “you have to win this kind of game” after his side were held to a frustrating draw by struggling West Brom. Baggies goalkeeper Sam Johnstone made two point-blank stoppage-time saves to deny City victory and leave Guardiola’s side sixth in the Premier League table, five points off the top. — AFP.
