Zimbabwe and Malawi want a business forum set up to facilitate trade and investment between the two countries according to a recommendation in the communiqué at the end of the 10th Session of the Zimbabwe-Malawi Joint Permanent Commission in Harare yesterday. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on promotion of Small and Medium Enterprises Development. The MOU was signed by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Sibusiso Moyo and his Malawian counterpart, Eisenhower Mkaka. “The two ministers underscored the important role played by the private sector in promoting trade and investment between the two countries,” reads part of the communique. “In this regard, they welcomed the cordial relations between ZimTrade and the Malawi Investment and Trade Centre. The two ministers encouraged the organisations to establish a business forum, an important vehicle for facilitating trade and investment cooperation between the private sector organisations.” In his remarks, Minister Moyo said the business forum was an excellent platform for those in the private sector to meet and network, identify opportunities and share experiences. <img class="size-full wp-image-519609" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/849A4732.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/849A4732.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/849A4732-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo and his Malawian counterpart Mr Eisenhower Mkaka sign MOUs at the Tenth Session of the Joint Permanent Commission on Cooperation between the two nations in Harare yesterday. – Picture: Believe Nyakudjara “It also provides a platform for the private sector to give feedback to our two governments on what is working and what needs improvement,” he said. “Our leaders are keen to listen to the private sector because they, indeed, are the drivers of our economies.” Minister Mkaka echoed similar sentiments, saying there was need to boost ties between the private sectors in the two countries.
