The Herald PARIS. — Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said it was one of his side’s biggest victory while Zinedine Zidane dismissed suggestions he might walk away from Real Madrid. The Reds advanced to the Round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League, after a 1-0 win over Ajax, while Madrid crashed to another defeat at the hands of Shakhtar Donetsk. Liverpool were without a host of key players for the visit of Ajax to Anfield in Group D, with 22-year-old Irishman Caoimhin Kelleher starting in goal in the absence of Alisson. Teenager Curtis Jones scored the only goal just before the hour, tucking the ball in after Ajax ‘keeper Andre Onana thought he could afford to let a Neco Williams cross sail over his head. The result was vital for the English Premier League champions after their home loss to Atalanta a week ago, and it allowed them to secure a spot in the knockout phase. “Honestly since I was at Liverpool that feels like one of the biggest Champions League nights. ‘’Without supporters in, it was the most important, most difficult, most exceptional,” Klopp told BT Sport. They will go through as group winners after Atalanta had to come from behind to draw 1-1 at home to Midtjylland, Cristian Romero heading in a late equaliser in response to Alexander Scholz’s thumping opener for the Danes. Atalanta are a point clear in second from Ajax, with the sides meeting in Amsterdam in their last game next week. Two-time former European champions Porto also sealed a last-16 spot after drawing 0-0 at home to Manchester City, who were already through and are now guaranteed to top Group C. — AFP.
