LOCAL bodybuilders will have an early Christmas present as they are scheduled to take part in the Harare Classic at the Zimbabwe College of Music this Saturday. The Harare Classic was last held in 2012 but it will make a huge return with five categories up for grabs. The contest, which is open to participants from across the country, will be the only one before the end of the year and will help prepare local athletes before the 2021 Arnolds Classic. Athletes will compete in the senior men bodybuilding Open, junior men bodybuilding up to 70kgs and including Under-23, men’s physique Open, men’s fitness Open and women’s bikini fitness Open. The overall winner in the men’s category will walk home US$600 richer. Event co-ordinator, Tarirai Chirume, said all is in place for the last tournament of the year to be staged, which will give bodybuilders an opportunity to be on the podium before the end of the year. “We are geared up for the return of the Harare Classic and we are happy with the preparations which both us organisers and athletes have made so far. “We are going to stick to the Covid-19 regulations and we will have a limited number of participants at the venue and ensure that social-distance is maintained. So far everything is in order and the prize monies are already there. The hulk will, however, face competition from several others like Allister Dimba, Garikai Mujuru and Gerald Woodend.
