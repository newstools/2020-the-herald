The Sate led by Mr Tafara Chirambira yesterday furnished the six with court papers to allow them to prepare for the hearing. It is alleged that on around noon on May 13 the six teamed up with several others and gathered at Warren Park 1 shopping centre in Harare before marching towards the Harare-Bulawayo Road. According to the State, they displayed and waved placards, one of which was inscribed “Unlock us before we revolt”. They were allegedly demonstrating against the extension of Covid-19 national lockdown and were intercepted and dispersed by the police.
