The Herald LONDON. — An “agreement in principle” over the Northern Ireland Protocol has been reached between UK and EU officials. The potentially landmark moment in the final stages to securing an overarching Brexit deal will see the government remove law-breaking clauses 44, 45 and 47 from the Internal Market Bill. It comes after Brussels confirmed trade talks could continue beyond a “last-chance saloon” meeting between Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen this week — for which a date has not yet been announced, only that it will take place in the “coming days”. A European Commission spokesperson told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday that the EU was willing to negotiate for “as long as necessary”. The comments contradict ones previously made by Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, who on Monday told MEPs that talks would not continue past Wednesday. Mr Johnson admitted earlier today that talks between the UK and the EU were “looking very, very difficult at the moment”. Speaking to Sky News at a hospital where the first Covid-19 vaccines were being administered, the PM said the government would “do our level best, but … there are great options ahead for our country on any view”. —Independent
