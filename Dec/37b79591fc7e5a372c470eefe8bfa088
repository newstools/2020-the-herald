The Herald Crime Reporter Disciplinary investigations are in progress against three more police officers appearing in viral video clips on social media. In one of the videos, a police officer is seen counting US dollar banknotes in an area yet to be identified. There is another similar video on other platforms. Police at roadblocks no longer take cash for deposit fines, but investigators want to eliminate the possibility that the clip is an old one before evoking the disciplinary code against the two. In the other clip confirmed to be at Braeside Police Station in Harare, an officer is seen shouting vulgar words at a suspect that had been arrested, before assaulting him and threatening him with detention. In a statement, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the ZRP does not condone acts of criminality such as corruption by officers.
