The Herald The importation and exportation of currency into and out of Zimbabwe is governed by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) in terms of the Exchange Control Act (Chapter 22:05). Importation The importation of any currency into Zimbabwe by travellers is not restricted. This implies that any person can bring in any amount of currency into Zimbabwe. However, all travellers are encouraged to complete a Customs Declaration Form (Form 47) and declare the currency in their possession at the time of entry. The processed declaration form maybe used: To support re-export of any balance of currency (for non-residents) at the end of the visit to Zimbabwe should it exceed the allowed export thresholds which is currently two thousand united states dollars or its equivalent in any other currency including Zimbabwean bond notes and coins. For acquittal of CD1 forms in the case of exporters of goods. As proof of the source of funds in some instances where proof is required. Exportation The exportation of currency from Zimbabwe is restricted. Please note that the amount of currency that a person who is about to leave Zimbabwe may possess, without authorisation in the departure lounge of an airport or any other port is a total of USD$2 000 or its equivalent. Non-Zimbabwean residents Non-Zimbabwean residents who have currencies above allowable threshold may be allowed to export the amount equal to or the balance of declared currencies upon arrival. Any excess currency found in possession of travellers without authority shall be seized and may be forfeited to the State. Zimbabwean Residents Zimbabwean residents who have currencies above allowable threshold may be allowed to export currency only with the authorisation from The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. In the event that the traveller does not have such an authorisation, no exportation maybe allowed regardless of the fact the currency was declared upon arrival. All travellers leaving Zimbabwe are urged to strictly adhere to the limits. Any excess currency found in possession of travellers without authority shall be seized and may be forfeited to the State.
