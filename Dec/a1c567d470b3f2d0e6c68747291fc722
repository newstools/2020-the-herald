The Herald Crime Reporter Suspected armed robber and gang leader Musa Taj Abdul (47), who was granted bail by High Court Judge Justice Benjamin Chikowero on Monday along with three co-accused before they were rearrested for three more charges, are expected to appear in court this morning. Abdul, Godfrey Mupamhanga (27), Rudolf Tapiwa Kanhanga (29) and Douglas Mutenda (31), remained in custody after police indicated that the four were facing fresh charges allegedly committed in Bulawayo, Buhera and Bindura. Before they could post bail money, police brought up fresh charges against the suspects and requested that they remain in custody pending their remand hearing on the new charges and further investigations. <img class="size-full wp-image-503611" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Untitled-3-14.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Untitled-3-14.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Untitled-3-14-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Musa Taj Abdul (extreme right) who had managed to evade capture for over 20 years and his 3 co-accused companions.
