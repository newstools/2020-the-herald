The blitz targeting illegal foreign currency dealers has been intensified in a bid to bring sanity on the streets and entrench economic stability, amid indications that about 40 such dealers have been arrested in Harare. Most of the dealers were fined, while others are expected to appear in court soon. A team of police officers has been deployed, targeting areas where the dealers normally operate. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi yesterday said the operation was continuing until sanity was restored. “The ZRP has observed the proliferation of illegal money dealers in cities and towns around the country and intensified its operations against all illegal forex dealers,” he said. “A total of 40 suspects were arrested in Harare CBD for dealing in foreign currency unlawfully.” During the past few months, police have been targeting illegal forex dealers by launching various operations against them, as they pose a serious security and economic threat to the country.
