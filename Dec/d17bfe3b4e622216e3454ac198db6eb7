ZIMBABWE’S professional golfer, Tudor Bismark Jnr, and rising amateur, Terrance Keith, failed to make it through the South African Open Championship qualifiers yesterday. The qualifiers were held at the ERPM Golf Club. The tournament will be held from tomorrow until Sunday and will be the last on the golf calendar this year. Bismark, who is son of Bishop Tudor Bismark, was giving it a try in a European Tour tournament, having travelled from his base in the United States. Yesterday’s single round was a tough one as only eight slots were up for grabs out of 53 entries that took to the field. The Zimbabwean pair found the course challenging with Bismark finishing at eight-over par while Keith was on 10-under. South African amateur, Christiaan Maas, was the first to book his place after an impressive eight-under par. He was joined by Chris Cannon, Leon Visser, Marko Styne, another amateur, Sean Bradley and Henning du Plooy. Scott Vincent and Ben Follet-Smith will represent the country as they are the only ones with exemptions.
