The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN jockey Rodgers Satombo was rewarded for his stellar performances during the 2020 horse racing season after he was named Apprentice Jockey of The Year at Borrowdale Park and Race course at the weekend. Satombo, who is making strides and has managed to give several professional riders a good run for their money, said he is happy for the recognition and will continue to work hard. “I am very happy for the recognition and I am going to continue working hard. There are a lot of good riders who gave us a good challenge after every fortnight and I respect them. “Received my Champion Apprentice award what a great feeling. Thank you so much to everyone who has supported me along the way!! “Congratulations to the owners of Dindingwe who won Champion. It’s been a privilege to ride her in all her races to date. “The recognition means I did well and I am grateful to stable owners who give me an opportunity to ride and express myself. I am now looking forward to next season as we are taking a break from the sport after last Friday’s last race of the year,” said Satombo. Satombo capped the year on a high note after he won the two races during Friday’s race and managed a single place in the five races he participated in. Satombo romped to victory with Cool Solution in race five the Merit Rated 60 Handicap before he rode True Beauty to a first place in race seven the Tote Free Handicap while his second place finish came in race six where he piloted What a Dandy in the Pinnacle Plate. In the Merit Rated 60 Handicap, Satombo, and partner True Beauty were favourites after stablemate Dindingwe was withdrawn. The duo, who run for Kirk Swanson yard, had recently won the 1200m Jacaranda Free Handicap and was set to face stablemate Magnus Maximus who had won two of his three starts but they managed to see off another tight contender who failed to make the top four.
