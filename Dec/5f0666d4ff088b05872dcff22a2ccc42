The Herald Fungai Lupande Mashonaland Central Bureau A 40-year-old man from Mvurwi fatally assaulted his ex-wife’s grandmother (71) with a log after accusing her of bewitching his son and later committed suicide by drowning himself. A few days after the grandmother, Faveri Faides of Bradjule Farm, died of her injuries, Previous Mereki of Dahwe Farm in Mvurwi tied a 20kg rock around his waist and threw himself into Rhimbic Dam. Mashonaland police spokesperson Inspector Fidelis Mundembe said that at around 9am on 30 November, Mereki accused Mrs Faides of bewitching his 8-year-old son, Innocent. The boy had fallen unconscious while visiting his grandmother. Following up, Mereki accused Mrs Faides of bewitching the boy, dragged her into her kitchen, pulled a log from the fireplace and hit her all over the body.
