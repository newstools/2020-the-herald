The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter PRE-RACE favourite Moxie, from the Gorkan Terzi yard, won the 1 800m Champion Fillies Stakes at Borrowdale Park on Saturday. The runner had Norbert Takawira on the irons, and they beat a strong field that had Diamonds ‘n’ Rubies, who came second. Futura Doro was third, as he failed to hang on over the distance, and Moxie came through to win. Milford Sound filled the last place of the main race of the day. The five-year-old mare Moxie recorded its sixth victory. By Brave Tin Soldier (US), and bred by Summerhill Stud, Moxie is trained by Gokhan Terzi’s satellite yard at Borrowdale Park, and owned by Gengiz Goksel. In the other race, Obscure got her act together at Borrowdale Park on Saturday, and came with a storming finish to win the 1450m Maiden Plate Obscure battled not to be outdone by her sister, Lily Blue who earlier in the week won her maiden race the Limpopo, at Vaal in South Africa. The Zimbabwe 2020 Champion Three-Year-Old, is doing well and has managed to give the South African runners a good run. Veseo, Tricky Business and Master Futura had to settle for the minor places. In the post-race interview trainer, Bridget Stidolph, said Obscure was a big filly who was taking time to mature. On Saturday, Obscure was ridden by Port Elizabeth jockey Teague Gould, and the three-year-old filly is owned by the Gin’ll Fix It Syndicate (nominee Kirsty Stidolph) and Betty Prosser.
