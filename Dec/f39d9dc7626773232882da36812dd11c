The Herald LONDON. — France has reopened its borders to travellers and truck drivers from the United Kingdom who show proof of a negative coronavirus test taken within the previous 72 hours. The two countries reached the deal on Tuesday after France closed the route on Sunday following news of an outbreak in southeast England of a new strain of coronavirus. The shutdown caused chaos for the crucial freight route between France and the UK, with thousands of truckers stranded in the port of Dover and unable to return to the continent. “We continue to urge hauliers not to travel to Kent until further notice as we work to alleviate congestion at port,” UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement. The agreement allows for rail, sea, and freight services to return to operation. It is set to be reviewed on December 31, but could run through January 6, according to the UK’s Department for Transport. All truck drivers will require a “lateral flow” coronavirus test, which can detect the new strain of Covid-19 and provide results in as little as 30 minutes. The French government will also carry out sample tests on incoming freight to the UK, according to the transport department. —NPR.
