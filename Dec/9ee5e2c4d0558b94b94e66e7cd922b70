Harare City Council’s human resources capital director Cainos Chingombe appeared at the Harare Magistrates Court yesterday facing allegations of transferring more than US$130 000 meant for the provision of water, sanitation, education and recreational services into his personal bank account. Chingombe allegedly bought a top-of-the-range car with the money. He was not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before Harare regional magistrate Mrs Marehwanazvo Gofa charged with criminal abuse of office and was remanded in custody to December 21 for routine remand. Chingombe was being represented by Professor Lovemore Madhuku. The State led by Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti alleged that on October 30, 2014, Chingombe allegedly connived with other city executives and transferred the money into his account from the council’s traditional beer levy account. The money is not part of the general revenue of the local authority and must be only used for the community welfare as approved by the Local Government Minister, according to the State. Chingombe is alleged to have bought a Land Cruiser Prado without the Minister’s approval or council resolution. He also allegedly violated the council’s procurement regulations, which, according to State stipulates that any procurement above US$10 000 should go through a tender. Chingombe is alleged to have bought the Prado for US$119 000 and allegedly pocketed the balance.
