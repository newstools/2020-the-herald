The Herald Court Reporter FOUR suspected robbers, who were using a Honda Fit to pounce on hitch hikers around Harareâ€™s Central Business District while one of them was masquerading as a policeman, appeared in court last Thursday charged with four counts of robbery. Leo Bhaureni, Innocent Dziyike, Confess Tinotenda and Shakespear Russell Samkange appeared before Harare provincial magistrate Mrs Vongai Guwuriro charged with armed robbery. The quartet was not asked to plead to the charges. They were remanded in custody to January 7 and were advised to approach the High Court for bail application. It is alleged that they robbed Rutendo Mandungumana, Kenneth Bosha, Primrose Madziwanzira and Saidi Maluwa on different occasions. The State led by Mrs Idah Maromo alleges that on December 22 Mandungumana and Bosha were at Simon Muzenda Bus Terminus intending to travel home from the city centre. The four arrived at the bus terminus in a Honda Fit. Samkange was wearing a ZRP uniform. They drove along Robert Mugabe Way and later turned into Hillside where they ended up driving along Glenara Road. Along the way, one of the quartet, who was seated at the back asked Mandungumana and Bosha to face down while demanding their belongings. They allegedly robbed them US$125 and other items before dumping them. On the same day at around 9pm, the quartet picked Madziwanzira and Maluwa at the same bus terminus and took them to a place across Glenara road before robbing them of cash and other items. Madziwanzira and Maluwa lodged a complaint at Rhodesville Police Station and a follow-up was made. The four suspected robbers were arrested while parked at Ok Mart leading to the recovery of some of the stolen items and cash.
