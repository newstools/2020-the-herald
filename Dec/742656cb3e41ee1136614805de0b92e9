The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation senior procurement officer Rosewinter Nyamuronda (36) and her administration officer Gladys Chikonye (33) on Tuesday appeared in court on allegations of crafting fake procurement quotations which they used to defraud their employer of more than $391 965. The two were facing two counts of fraud when they appeared before Harare provincial magistrate Mrs Vongai Muchuchuti Guwuriro. They were freed on $3 000 bail each. As part of their bail conditions, they were ordered not to interfere with witnesses and to continue residing at their given addresses. The court heard that on October 5, 2020, the pair was tasked by their employer to look for three quotations for detergents from different companies which are on the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) list. It is the State’s case that the duo connived and crafted fake quotation, purportedly to be issued from Yaborts Company of number 42 Lord Malvern Avenue, Waterfalls. It is alleged that police checked the company address which showed that it did not exist. The court heard that investigations were conducted and it was discovered that Yaborts company quotation was fake and ZBC was prejudiced of $118 365. On the second count, the court heard that on November 17, the pair was tasked to look for three other quotations for tilling Mbare studios northern wing from different companies that are on the PRAZ list. The two connived and crafted fake quotation purportedly issued from BSCC company and Legacy Construction company. The court heard that the address of Legacy Construction given as 2238 Budiriro 5, Harare was checked by police and they discovered that it did not exist. Further investigations revealed that BSCC mixer quotation was fake. As a result of the pair’s actions ZBC was prejudiced of $273 600. Ms Idah Maromo appeared for the State.
