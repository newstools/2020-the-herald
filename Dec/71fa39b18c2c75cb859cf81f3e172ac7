Debate on the 2021 National Budget started in the National Assembly this week, with the House resolving to suspend procedural requirements such as automatic adjournment at 6.55pm to allow legislators to discuss the Budget. Parliament yesterday suspended question time, usually earmarked for Wednesdays where ministers will be fielding questions from backbenchers. The move was aimed at prioritising debate on the 2021 National Budget that was presented a fortnight ago by Finance and Economic Development Minister, Professor Mthuli Ncube. Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, who is Leader of Government Business in the House, sought leave to defer the Question and Answer Session. <img class="size-full wp-image-479164" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/1803-1-1-ZIYAMBI-ZIYAMBI-23-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/1803-1-1-ZIYAMBI-ZIYAMBI-23-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/1803-1-1-ZIYAMBI-ZIYAMBI-23-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Ziyambi Debate started with Parliament’s portfolio committee chairpersons presenting their reports after they held-post Budget consultative meetings last week with the Government ministries they monitor. In its report, the Budget and Finance Committee chaired by Chikomba Central legislator, Cde Felix Mhona (Zanu PF), commended Prof Ncube for coming up with a balanced Budget. Although total bids submitted to Treasury by ministries and departments were much higher than the capacity of revenues and borrowings, Prof Ncube did well in balancing demands. The committee saw some room to manoeuvre within the spending ceiling of $421,6 billion. “The committee, however, feels there is room for improvement in the Budget in order to best match it with the views of the public,” said Cde Mhona. “Given the macro-fiscal stabilisation objectives of the Budget and the National Development Strategy 1, adhering to an expenditure ceiling of $421,6 billion is imperative.” The committee commended Treasury for allocating $8,2 billion for social protection programmes, but emphasised the need for timely implementation of the measures and better policy coordination in the Budget execution through alignment of action plans to the realisation of social and economic rights of the citizens, especially people with disabilities, the elderly and the vulnerable. “The committee commends the Minister of Finance and Economic Development for crafting a productivity-orientated Budget which is couched on the need to put Zimbabwe on a growth trajectory,” said Cde Mhona. “The committee also commends the Minister for incorporating most of the recommendations from Parliament. The committee calls upon all stakeholders to put all hands on the deck to ensure successful implementation of the Budget and the NDS1. In that regard, Parliament must be adequately capacitated to monitor Budget implementation.” The portfolio committee on Mines and Mining Development chaired by Shurugwi South legislator, Cde Edmond Mkaratigwa, wanted Treasury to support the mining sector for the country to realise its potential. <img class="size-full wp-image-517834" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/Edmond-Mkaratigwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/Edmond-Mkaratigwa.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/Edmond-Mkaratigwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Mr Edmond Mkaratigwa “Zimbabwe faces crucial decisions regarding its mining sector, which ultimately will affect its long-term development and progress and for the ministry to continue to increase its revenue generation capacity and to be able to carry out its priority projects and programmes in line with the National Development Strategy 1,” he said.
