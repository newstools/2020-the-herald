THE Christmas holidays are here and for most Zimbabwean sports personalities, just like many other people, it’s that time of the year they take a break from their busy schedules to spend more time with their families. Although it has been a difficult year, with a number of challenges because of the Covid-19 pandemic, most people are still looking forward to the festive season. It is just that time of the year when people get together, share and cheer each other up. Although this year, with Covid-19 restrictions and regulations to contain the pandemic, it may be slightly different but people remain hopeful they can still have something to smile about and hope for a better 2021. The Zimbabwe senior netball team captain Felisitus Kwangwa, who is now based in the United Kingdom, will be spending the day with her host family at her new base. “For the Christmas holidays I don’t have plans yet but I think I will spend Christmas Day with my host family. That’s what I am going to do… It’s my first time being with them so I think it’s going to be a great Christmas holiday,” said Kwangwa. She, however, urged Zimbabweans to follow the Covid-19 regulations for the safety of everyone. “Zimbabwean people let’s stay safe. Let’s follow the Covid-19 regulations. This monster is real, let’s just follow the regulations. It’s better to be safe rather than to try and fight against the virus when you have been infected. “Let’s enjoy our holiday, I know it’s disappointing that we are not going to do a lot of things we are used to do but life is important. “So, stay safe so we can always celebrate the next Christmas,” Kwangwa said. Sprinter Ngoni Makusha will spend the holidays away from home as he is in South Africa for the Olympics qualification preparations at the High Performance Centre. “Well, I am spending my Christmas and New Year in South Africa training. It’s an Olympic year next year, so I have committed to train this festive season, so there is no time to celebrate. So this festive season is definitely different from the others,” Makusha said. The Zimbabwe women’s cricket team captain Mary-Anne Musonda will be visiting her family in Mutare and she also pointed out the importance of staying safe. “I will not be doing much. I will just be with family and visit my family in Mutare. That’s basically what I will be doing. “I think with Covid-19, it’s still around, there are cases that are still being confirmed, so we still need to take precaution, sanitising, and wearing masks, and social distancing. “But with family, it might be a bit difficult, so it’s just minimising the number of people who will be gathering. But otherwise we will just try to still enjoy Christmas but also observing the precautions that are there,” Musonda said. Cestoball Association of Zimbabwe president, Amon Madzvamuse, will be travelling to his rural home in Madziva. “I am going to my rural home in Madziva in Bindura and we are going to slaughter a goat during this festive season to make sure that we celebrate the life we have since we have come through 2020, which was a hard year with a lot of challenges as well. “I am going with my family, not other relatives, so this year we are going to miss our relatives as we cannot gather and some will be coming from different provinces so that alone we have to make sure we don’t do it because it would spread the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Madzvamuse. <img class="size-full wp-image-521217" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Untitled-4-4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Untitled-4-4.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Untitled-4-4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Amon Madzvamuse For Zimbabwe national cricket team captain Chamu Chibhabha it will be Christmas at home as they welcome a new member to the family after his wife recently gave birth. “Well my wife just gave birth yesterday, so we can’t really do anything for Christmas travelling-wise, so we are going to be spending Christmas at home this time. “To be honest, with the newly-born baby coming only a couple of days people are going to want to come and congratulate us and see the baby; and that’s one thing I am really worried about Covid-19-wise. “You don’t know people’s status whether they are positive or they are negative because not everyone shows symptoms all the time so yeah it’s gonna be one of those Christmases that you might just have to be just your family. Even close relatives you would want to have them around but still it’s a tough call,” Chibhabha said. <img class="size-full wp-image-521219" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Untitled-3-5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Untitled-3-5.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Untitled-3-5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Eddie Nyatanga Zimbabwe National Soccer Supporters Association founding leader, Eddie “Mboma” Nyatanga, said he is likely to travel to Thailand with his family next week for a short holiday. “I am going to Thailand with my wife and daughter Thandeka. We are leaving on the 22nd of December. “We are back on the 30th of December then we go to Victoria Falls for New Year before we go to South Africa for Covid-19 and health checks,” Nyatanga said.
