The Herald Crime Reporter A 19-year-old Lupane woman has been arrested on allegations of burying an infant she had given birth to in a garden at her homestead. The woman had given birth to a baby boy on November 27. The matter came to light a few days later when she asked for sanitary pads from a relative last week who became suspicious and informed the police, leading to her arrest. The child’s remains have since been exhumed and taken to a hospital in the area. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the death of the infant and the arrest. “We can confirm that a 19-year-old Lupane woman has been arrested in connection with a case of infanticide where she gave birth to a baby boy on November 27, 2020. She dug a pit in the garden and buried the infant. “The offence was discovered on December 3, 2020 after the suspect requested for some pads from the informant who got suspicious and reported the case,” he said.
