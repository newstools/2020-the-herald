The Herald LONDON.  — Mikel Arteta says he’s aiming to get Arsenal playing in a 4-3-3 formation but says he doesn’t currently have the right personnel in five to six positions. “For me the way we occupy space and who is going to move in there is more important than the formation,” he said. “And from there we have some very similar players that are not used to play in those positions so we have to keep changing the formation a little bit. “We want to move to a 4-3-3 but for that, you need a lot of specificity in every position but now in five or six positions, we don’t have it. “The aggressiveness, the effectiveness, the amount of steals we make in opposition half I think we have been very steady against some big clubs. “I think that what we miss is in the opponent’s area and the last part of the pitch. We have to find the key in the attack, that last decision, that last pass, that last cross to create a goal situation, a goal, a shot, a corner, etc.” The boss went on to outline his plans for the club in the long, mid and short-term. — Sky Sports.
