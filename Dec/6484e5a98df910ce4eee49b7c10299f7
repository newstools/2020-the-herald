The Herald MANCHESTER.  — Edinson Cavani apologised on Monday after his joy at scoring twice for Manchester United against Southampton was dampened by an investigation by the English Football Association into a social media post he subsequently deleted. The 33-year-old Uruguayan striker sent an Instagram post thanking a friend for his congratulations after scoring twice as United came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 on Sunday that included the Spanish word “negrito” (small black person). United said the word was clearly used in an affectionate manner and has different connotations in South America. The former Paris Saint Germain forward had been informed such terms are viewed as derogatory in Britain and he subsequently deleted the post. “The message I posted after the match on Sunday was intended as an affectionate greeting to a friend, thanking him for his congratulations after the game,” Cavani said in a statement. — AFP.
