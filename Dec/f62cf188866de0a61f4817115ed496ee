AB Communications Private Limited, the multimedia group that owns several radio stations, television production and other media, has announced that Mrs Susan Makore will be stepping down from her position as chief executive officer (CEO) on December 31. In a statement today, AB Comunications said Mrs Makore was recently  nominated by Parliament and sworn in by the President Mnangagwa as a Commissioner of the Zimbabwe Media Commission. “She has been with AB Communications for 12 years during which she championed the growth of the business into radio, newspaper industry and outdoor advertising,” read the statement. <img class="wp-image-521162 size-large" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Benson-680x488.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="488" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Benson-680x488.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Benson-360x258.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Benson-768x551.jpg 768w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/Benson.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Benson  Mbewe Commenting on her departure, Mrs Makore said : “It is a very emotional moment for me to leave the organisation. It had become home. But it’s imperative that when national duty calls, one has to move on. I am happy though that I am leaving the organization solid and geared for even greater growth. I have no doubt that it’s future is orange, it is bright. ” While it is not a statutory requirement for media commissioners to not take up employment in media organizations, Mrs Makore said the potential conflict of interest at the level of CEO, was apparent and therefore it would be awkward to maintain the two positions. AB Communications also announced the appointment of Benson Mbewe to take up the position of Group CEO. “Benson is an astute business leader, marketer and strategist with vast experience in the media and financial sectors. With 10 years working experience in the financial and media sectors, Benson is a passionate digital marketer and a strong believer in innovation and creativity for corporate sustainability. Benson’s educational qualifications include Bachelor of Business Studies (University of Zimbabwe – UZ) Master of Business Administration (UZ) and Master of Develoment Policy (KDI) South Korea.”
