A Mbare woman was taken to court after being arrested while transporting agricultural inputs meant for the Presidential Inputs Scheme from Matabeleland, which she intended to resell across the country. Sekayi Masanjelo Roki Ntuli was said to have already sold 100 bags of fertiliser to a Nyanga farmer. She appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Judith Taruvinga charged with illegal sale of State-supplied agricultural inputs. The State, led by Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti, told the court that on Monday police were informed that Ntuli was trading in Presidential agricultural inputs she was acquiring from Matabeleland. On the same day, Ntuli was intercepted by police, while she was with a 30-tonne truck loaded with inputs at Zuva Service Station along Samora Machel in Harare. Upon being interviewed, Ntuli allegedly told the police that she had bought the inputs from someone called Mai Martin, operating a company called Cosmo Spar (Pvt Ltd), located in Bulawayo. The police allegedly found 205 bags of cotton bulk blend fertiliser, 41 bags ammonium nitrate, six bags of top dressing and 152 bags of compound D. State opposed to granting of her bail.
