The Herald Bitcoin yesterday jumped to a record US$28 599,99, after the digital currency almost quadrupled in value this year amid heightened interest from bigger investors. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency was last up 2,3 percent at US$28 012. It has surged by nearly half since breaking US$20 000 for the first time on December 16. Bitcoin has increasingly seen demand from larger US investors in particular, attracted by its perceived inflation-hedging qualities and potential for quick gains, as well as expectations it would become a mainstream payments method. — Online.
