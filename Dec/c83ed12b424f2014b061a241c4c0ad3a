DAVISON Elijah was crowned the 2020 Mashwede Open golf champion after winning a tightly-contested affair at Falcon on Saturday. Elijah had to go through two play-offs against high-rising Tafara Mpofu, who had managed to finish level with him on 148 overall at the end of the two rounds of the contest. The seasoned professional, Elijah, had rounds of 75 and 73 to make the top spot but he had to find his way against Mpofu, who played in the last ball. The Mashwede Open returned to the local professional circuit after five years and saw 36 professional golfers taking to the field. Elijah, a veteran golfer who is into mining, said he was happy after pocketing the US$1 500 first prize. The tournament was sponsored to the tune of US$6 000. “I am grateful. But I must say I got a tough challenge from Tafara. I had thought it as over after I had completed my rounds above everyone else, only to see that there is going to be a play-off when I checked the leader board for the last time. “I am happy that the under-par tournaments, which we take part in, are helpful as we seek low scores.” Mpofu was second after he was beaten in the play-offs. He had carded 71 and 77 for 148 overall which forced a play-off with Elijah. William Lake was tied on position three with Never Milanzi after they both had 149 total at the completion of the two-match rounds. Anyway Watch, Doctor Maphosa and Jack Allard were tied on fifth after they finished on 150 overall. Tendai Mashayamhanda, son to the tournament sponsor, Alex “Dr. Mash” Mashamhanda, said the success of the tournament was a birthday present to their father. “We organised this tournament with my elder brother Tapiwa and the success was a present to our dad, who recently turned 70. “We are happy with the level of competition and it is now going to be an annual event,” said Tendai Mashamhanda.
