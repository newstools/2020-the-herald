VINCENT Kandiyero was crowned Mr Harare Classic after he beat pre-tournament favourite Nunurai Masosonere at the Zimbabwe College of Music on Saturday. “Vince Carter”, as Kandiyero is affectionately known, was literally a cut above the rest as he outclassed more than seven other contestants who took to the stage in this bodybuilding contest. The hulk walked away with US$600 first prize. “I am happy to win again, especially after experiencing a difficult year because of the coronavirus lockdown. l never stopped working hard and l would want to acknowledge my wife and kids for their support. I am now looking forward to the Arnold Classic. “I would like to thank organisers for bringing up this contest for us. We really needed it as bodybuilders. I am also grateful to the judges for recognising my efforts,” said Kandiyero. Masosonere, who has won several times in the past, could not match the well-built Kandiyero.
