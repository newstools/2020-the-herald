The Herald BAHRAIN. — Romain Grosjean says he “saw death coming” in his fiery crash in the Bahrain Grand Prix and fought to get out “for his children”. The French Haas driver suffered burns to the back of his hands after crashing at 137mph and sustaining an impact of 53G on the first lap of Sunday’s race. Grosjean said that he should be leaving hospital yesterday after escaping a fiery high-speed crash in the Bahrain Formula One Grand Prix. French driver Grosjean is being treated for the burns he sustained to his hands while jumping out of his blazing Haas car following a collision with Daniil Kvyat on the first lap of Sunday’s race. “I’m leaving the hospital normally tomorrow (yesterday). I’m getting better and better, obviously a few parts are a bit painful but it’s OK,” Grosjean said in a video posted on Twitter. “After what happened I guess the pain is not too bad. I’m happy to be alive and talk to you.” “I would say there is a feeling of being happy to be alive, of seeing things differently,” he said. Speaking to France’s TF1, he added: “But also there is the need to get back in the car, if possible in Abu Dhabi.” The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is the final race of the 2020 season, on December 13-15, after a second race in Bahrain on a different track layout this weekend. Grosjean said he wanted to race at Yas Marina “to finish my story with Formula 1 in a different way”. He does not have a drive for next season, after Haas decided to change their line-up and recruit two new drivers who come with financial backing for 2021. They announced Russian Nikita Mazepin on Tuesday and confirmed Mick Schumacher, son of seven-time champion Michael, yesterday. Team boss Gunther Steiner said on Tuesday that he had spoken to Grosjean about his intention to return for the final race and there was “plenty of time” before a decision had to be made. — BBC Sport.
