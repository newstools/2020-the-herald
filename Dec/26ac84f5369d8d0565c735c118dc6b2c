The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter It is Christmas today and some who are privileged enough are opening their presents. With Covid-19 restrictions and regulations affecting most of the joints where people used patronise with their families like the Lake Chivero or Country Club, it seems this year’s Christmas is being celebrated with a difference. People are largely stuck at home, those who are travelling to rural areas are cautious, while those rural folks too are scared of visitors coming with Covid-19. <img class="size-full wp-image-522102" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/2412-1-1-UNNAMED-33.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/2412-1-1-UNNAMED-33.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/2412-1-1-UNNAMED-33-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joe Njagu In some places, it is still a myth that coronavirus does not exist or that it is only found in the towns. So what are people doing today? What are some of the plans by our local celebrities, how are they celebrating this festive holiday? According to an official in the hotel industry, most hotels and lodges in resort towns such as Kariba, Masvingo, the Eastern Highlands and Victoria Falls are fully booked for the festive season. In an interview, most people said despite the Covid-19 situation, they are still going to celebrate Christmas although this year would be low-key. United Kingdom-based Zimbabwe gospel power couple Bishop Admire Kasi and Ivy Kombo said since the lockdown has been tightened in Britain, they choose to celebrate this Christmas indoors and pray. The couple, who were in the country last week, said there was nothing exciting this festive season because of the pandemic. <img class="size-full wp-image-522104" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/2412-1-1-UNNAMED-36.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/2412-1-1-UNNAMED-36.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/2412-1-1-UNNAMED-36-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Primrose Kurima “We will be home and use the opportunity to create prayer groups over the cellphones and pray for families whose celebration has been turned into mourning due to Covid-19 effects. We were in Zimbabwe a few days ago and luckily we arrived on time before the new lockdown measures.” “Ivy will also find time and perfect her new song in the studio in which she collaborated with Mambo Dhuterere,” said Kasi. Former Miss Zimbabwe Tendai Hunda said this year she was not travelling abroad but will be home. “In light of the prevailing global pandemic, this year we have decided to spend Christmas as a small family in the comfort of our home,” she said. Award-winning film maker Joe Njagu said the pandemic had affected his plans with family, although he managed to achieve some of the objectives he had set out for himself during the lockdown. “With Covid-19 this year, it is a different Christmas vibe. “I am used to travelling away for the holidays but this time we have to stay put. We will try to enjoy as much with family,”  said Njagu “We will be at the parents’ place, hanging out. I personally have some work to do but today will take the day off,” he said. Events planner Primrose Kurima said she wanted to travel to Inyanga but was scared of the pandemic. “It is now scary to travel with the numbers we hear each day on the news about coronavirus. “People should be alert and observe the restrictions and guidelines. I am still surprised that there are some who are moving around without wearing masks. “We had planned a get-away with my husband but unfortunately we have shelved the plans. We will be home and will cook his favourite dish,” said Kurima “This year is very boring as nothing much can be done but I am happy that people are shopping and preparing,” she said. It seems that most people will be home and we encourage those who are travelling to drive safely and still observe the Covid-19 regulations and restrictions. Parties and musical live functions are still banned until further notice as said by the police and National Arts Council of Zimbabwe.
