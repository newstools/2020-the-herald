The Herald A Chinese tycoon who died on Christmas Day was poisoned, Shanghai police say. Lin Qi, 39, was the chairman and chief executive of games developer Yoozoo, best known for the Game of Thrones: Winter Is Coming strategy game. The Shanghai police statement pointed to one of Mr Lin’s colleagues – identified only by his surname Xu – as the main suspect. Mr Lin was believed to have a net worth of around 6,8 billion yuan (US$1,3bn), according to the Hurun China Rich List. Many employees and ex-employees gathered outside Yoozoo’s office last Friday to mourn his death. The businessman was a star of China’s lucrative gaming market and had also made a foray into film production. He founded Yoozoo in 2009 and successfully led the company through a period where the gaming industry saw substantial changes towards mobile gaming.-BBC.
