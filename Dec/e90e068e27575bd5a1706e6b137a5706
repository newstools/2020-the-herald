The Herald Bulawayo Bureau PRESIDENT Mnangagwa has donated 1 000 litres of hand sanitiser and 500 masks to Khami and Bulawayo Prisons to help curb the spread of Covid-19. The two prisons early this year made headlines for being Covid-19 hotspots in Bulawayo, with 25 prison guards and 76 inmates testing positive to Covid-19 at one point. The hand sanitisers and masks were donated to the President by the National University of Science and Technology (Nust) last month. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-521344" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/donation.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/donation.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/donation-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The donation was handed over to the two prisons by Bulawayo Provincial Affairs Minister Judith Ncube. Speaking at the ceremony, Minister Ncube commended Nust for producing certified sanitisers which have been distributed countrywide to fight Covid-19. “Nust students and members of staff are doing us proud as a province and country as they are contributing a lot to fighting the spread of the pandemic. “This donation by the President will go a long way in minimising the exposure of both inmates and prison staff to the pandemic,” said Minister Ncube. Nust Vice Chancellor Professor Mqhele Dlodlo said: “These sanitisers have been widely distributed in the southern region and a few other areas. The products passed the Standards Association of Zimbabwe tests and we need the international standard organisations to certify them so that we can start exporting.” Prof Dlodlo said the university was planning to start producing disinfectants soon.
