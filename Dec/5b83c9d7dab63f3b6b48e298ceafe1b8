The Herald Bongani Ndlovu Showbiz Correspondent Stunner, one of the pioneers of the Urban Grooves music revolution in Zimbabwe has been honoured as the Zim Hip Hop artiste of the decade by the Zim Hip Hop Awards organisers. Real name Desmond Chideme, Stunner rose to fame during the early 2000s when urban grooves music was beginning to take dominance in the entertainment circles. Years later, with his Tazoita Cash Records, he is dominating the Zim hip hop or popular music sphere. With several hits including Dhaf’khorera, Godo, Team Hombe, Panofa Munhu and most recently Ndakarosva Rufu, Stunner was well deserving of this honour. Also honoured at the awards were Holy Ten who bagged three awards and R. Peels and Asaph who walked away with two gongs each at the Pogues Zim Hip Hop awards that were held at the HICC on Saturday. <img class="size-full wp-image-520321" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/screenshot_20201006-061240-e1601957705317.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/screenshot_20201006-061240-e1601957705317.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/screenshot_20201006-061240-e1601957705317-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Holy Ten It was Holy Ten’s year as he bagged Song of the Year with his track Ndaremerwa, People’s Choice and Best Newcomer.
