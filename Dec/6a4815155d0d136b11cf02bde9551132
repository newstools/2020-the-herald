The Herald A British ban on flights from South Africa over a new variant of the coronavirus in the country has punctured hopes of a rebound in the South African tourism industry in the new year, according to frustrated travel operators. UK officials ordered flights and arrivals from South Africa to be halted last Wednesday after the potentially more infectious variant was found to have reached Britain, which itself is battling to contain another fast-spreading variant. Tourism is a crucial sector for South Africa, accounting for nearly 9 percent of its economic output. Britain is the biggest source of tourism to the country, and the decision to halt flights could dent a much-needed recovery, operators said. “We realised a massive pent-up demand was unfolding for January. But this travel ban is a major setback now,” said Michael Tollman, Group CEO of Cullinan Holdings Ltd. The ban stigmatises South Africa and hits the industry hard, said Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa, CEO of Tourism Business Council of South Africa. –
