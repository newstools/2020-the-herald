The Herald FORMER Bafana Bafana and Manchester United player Quinton Fortune has signed a coaching contract with English Championship side Reading. The club announced on their official website yesterday. Fortune arrives at the club as part of the Royals new manager’s first-team staff and joined Serbian gaffer Veljko Paunovic on the training pitch at Bearwood Park for the first time yesterday. He will be the first-team coach. Among his player personnel will be midfielder, Andy Rinomhota, who has been targeted by the Warriors to feature for them. The 23-year-old midfielder has transformed himself into one of the key players and featured in 37 matches in the Championship last season. He scored once and provided three assists. Rinomhota has also featured for the Royals this season, in the 3-1 win over Colchester, in an EFL Cup match five days ago. Fortune played alongside the incoming Serbian boss at Atlético Madrid in the early part of their professional careers but is better known in the UK for seven years spent at Old Trafford. On the international scene, Quinton was capped 46 times by South Africa, representing his nation in two World Cups in 1998 and 2002 and in an African Cup of Nations Final against Egypt. The latter part of his playing career included short spells at Bolton, in Italy with Brescia and then at Belgian side Tubize before a small taste of the Championship was earned at Doncaster Rovers in 2009. He returned to United to complete his badges before a coaching stint with Cardiff City in 2014. Now he leaves Old Trafford’s youth set-up to join Veljko’s coaching team at the Madejski, where he links up with former United teammate John O’Shea as part of the Royals’ first team set-up. — SuperSport/Sports Reporter
