The Herald Court Correspondent A Harare vendor has dragged her boyfriend before the Harare Civil Court demanding $4 000 for the upkeep of their minor child. Netsai January, a vendor in Harare, on Friday told magistrate Nyasha Marufu that her boyfriend, Edward Chingwani, had enough income to take care of the child. “I want $4 000 for one minor child aged 12,” she said. “The child’s needs have increased as he will be enrolling for Form One next year. Edward works at ZMT and earns $16 000 so he can afford to take care of his child. He is married and he has three other children under his care.” Chingwani offered $3 500, saying he had a lot of responsibilities under him as he had three more children. “I can only give her $3 500 because I earn $15 000,” he said. January disputed Chingwani’s salary and kept insisting that he earned $16 000. Mrs Marufu ordered January to get Chingwani’s proof of earnings at his workplace before postponing the matter to September 23 for ruling.
