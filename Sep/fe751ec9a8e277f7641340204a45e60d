The Herald PRETORIA. — President Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday called on South Africans of different races, colours, and tribes to coexist peacefully in their diversity. President Ramaphosa said this while addressing the Heritage Day Celebrations. He called for the protection of indigenous languages and cultures. “The greatest thing about heritage is its dynamism. Heritage is a source of identity and cohesion for our nation. It makes us who we are. Heritage shapes and moulds us, and gives us a sense of belonging. Let us also appreciate that in practicing our cultures freely and openly, and in speaking our native languages, we are reclaiming not just our heritage, but our pride and our dignity as South Africans,” he said. President Ramaphosa stated that the country is eager to preserve the indigenous knowledge of traditional medicines which could be an answer to Covid-19. “ . . . we are also looking at the real and important contribution indigenous knowledge systems, particularly traditional medicine, can play in improving the health outcomes of our people,” he said.  — Xinhua.
