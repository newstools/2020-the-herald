Lance Corporal Mupanganyama died on admission at Chivhu General Hospital, while Zvirevo suffered multiple injuries. Corporal Stanalious Chiunye was part of the army and police crack-team on an operation to arrest the two assailants when he was injured in a shootout with the duo that was eventually killed.

Speaking to journalists after interacting with the injured, VP Chiwenga expressed confidence that the two would recover quickly. He commended the doctors for working round the clock to ensure the two were in a stable condition. “I am satisfied that the doctors have done the best they can,” said VP Chiwenga. “The operation on Zvirevo went on well.” VP Chiwenga hailed the security forces crack team that accounted for the assailants in less than 24 hours after the shootout. “It is a great lesson to everyone in the country that such acts should not be done,” he said. “Anyone daring to do such evil acts would be accounted for.” The Vice President expressed his heartfelt condolences to the family of Corporal Mupanganyama following his death. “We are really sorry about what happened,” he said. “We lost a fine young man dedicated to his duty. We lost a soldier who was doing his job, protecting people at a time we are fighting this invisible enemy, Covid-19. He was not suspecting anything at all. What is good is that the two fugitives have been accounted for.” <img class="size-full wp-image-504734" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/0609-1-1-PAGE-1-CHIVHU-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/0609-1-1-PAGE-1-CHIVHU-2.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/0609-1-1-PAGE-1-CHIVHU-2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> inside the police post in which two soldiers were attacked on Saturday.

Our soldiers and police are giving assurance to the nation that they will always protect our people and protect our territorial integrity. “We are pleased that our police and members of the ZNA, working on a tip-off from the public, managed to track down the assailants to near Gutu. In trying to disarm the two, who were now armed with not only a pistol, but also two of our rifles, another soldier was injured when they opened fire. We understand that he is in a stable condition.”
