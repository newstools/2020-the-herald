The Herald CHICAGO. —Basketball legend Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin have formed a single-car Nascar Cup Series team, with Bubba Wallace as their driver. Wallace is Nascar’s sole full-time black driver while Jordan is the second black team owner at its elite level. Earlier this year, Wallace successfully campaigned to get the Confederate flag banned from Nascar races. Six-time NBA champion Jordan said the team would “educate a new audience”. The 57-year-old added it would also “open more opportunities for black people in racing”. — BBC Sport.
