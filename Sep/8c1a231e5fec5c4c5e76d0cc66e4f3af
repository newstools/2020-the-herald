The Herald LONDON. — English cricket side Essex have said there needs to be more education on cultural diversity after a Muslim player was sprayed with alcohol during Bob Willis Trophy celebrations.  Batsman Feroze Khushi had beer poured over him on the balcony at Lord’s as Essex displayed the trophy following Sunday’s victory over Somerset. The 21-year-old, who was 12th man for Essex during the final against Somerset, did not play in the final. Khushi was photographed recoiling as beer was poured over him on the balcony at Lord’s. His club admitted the celebrations failed to meet their inclusive values and pledged to do more. “(The celebrations) did not meet the inclusive values of the organisation,” a club statement said. “Essex prides themselves on their work within multi-diverse communities throughout the county and the surrounding areas. “For a substantial period of time, Essex have had a multi-diverse team with players from different backgrounds, religions, and races, where cricket is at the heart of these communities. “The club has worked extremely hard and will continue to bring cricket to anybody and everybody, and educate on diversity, but further work needs to be done across both sport and society in general, to widen people’s knowledge and make them more aware of cultural differences.” After England’s World Cup victory in 2019, Muslim players Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid stepped away before other players sprayed champagne. Essex reasserted their status as the leading side in English cricket’s red-ball format by claiming the inaugural Bob Willis Trophy after a five-day draw was settled on first-innings runs. — BBC Sport.
