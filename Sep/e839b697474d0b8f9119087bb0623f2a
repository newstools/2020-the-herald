Four Mwenezi men allegedly teamed up and fatally assaulted a suspected stock thief last week. Simon Matongo (18), Morerest Chivasa (21),Tinashe Machesa (20) and Richardo Moyo (18) from Peter Perengwe Village of Hunzvi Farm under Chief Mazetese, recently appeared before Mwenezi resident magistrate, Mr Honest Musiiwa, who remanded them in custody to October 6, for trial. Prosecutor Mr Laiton Katsidzira told the court that on September 18, the four and other villagers who are still on the run, ganged up and assaulted Kudakwashe Hlangani whom they accused of being a habitual stock thief. They allegedly assaulted Hlangani until he died on the spot. Villagers who witnessed the incident then reported the matter to police, leading to the arrest of the four. Police recovered a blood-stained hat from the scene, which belonged to Hlangani. His body was then ferried to Masvingo provincial hospital mortuary for a post-mortem.
