The Herald MOSCOW. — Valtteri Bottas profited from a 10-second penalty for team-mate and Formula One championship leader Lewis Hamilton to end his wait for a second win of the 2020 season in the Russian Grand Prix yesterday. Hamilton, the pole sitter, went into the race under investigation for making two practice starts from the wrong place in the pit lane on his reconnaissance laps to the grid, around 35 minutes before the Grand Prix started. The world champion was handed two five-second penalties from stewards on lap eight, which he then served in the pit lane before his lap-17 pit stop. He also had two further penalty points added to his licence — pushing him just two more away from a race ban. The delay dropped the Englishman, who could have equalled Michael Schumacher’s F1 wins record, to 11th although he still salvaged a podium with third place. Russian GP Top 10
