The Herald Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter PERRENIAL women’s football champions, Black Rhinos Queens, stand a big chance to represent the country in the newly-launched Champions League next year. Last week, CAF revealed the format for the tournament. According to the format, six teams will proceed to the Champions League final, after winning the sole ticket from the zones. The host country will provide the seventh team while the eighth team will be picked as a wild card. The venue for the inaugural Champions League is yet to be determined. The South Africa Football Association have expressed their interest in hosting the tournament and they are expected to submit their bid this week. Zimbabwe representatives will have to compete with other clubs from South Africa, Zambia, Botswana and Namibia. Yesterday, Zimbabwe Women’s Soccer League chairperson, Barbra Chikosi, said if football doesn’t resume in time, they will forward Black Rhinos’ name for the Champions League. “We will have to pick the 2019 winner,’’ she said. “We will assist the club, which will represent the country in the Champions League, with some of the money which came from FIFA. “They will be representing our league and clubs and they need our support.’’ Women’s football received US$500 000, as part of Covid relief package, and part of the money has already been disbursed to the clubs to cushion them against effects of the prolonged lockdown. ZIFA women’s football desk administrator, Theresa Maguraushe, believes the army side have proven they are a force to reckon with in women’s football. “We have had Black Rhinos winning the championship and fulfilling all their matches,’’ she said.
