The Herald MAPUTO. — A journalist in Cabo Delgado argues that the armed attacks in the north of the country are based on economic and criminal interests, and says the Mozambican state should ask for external support in the face of an “unmistakable” situation. Speaking to DW Africa Moz24horas editorial director Luís Nhachote, who is also coordinator of the Centre for Investigative Journalism in Mozambique, said; “I think that the situation we are experiencing is unmistakable, and the Mozambican state needs to ask for support from its neighbours. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has a very important role to play in this matter.” According to the information released recently by Carta de Moçambique, armed men have attacked Vamisse Island, about 9km from the Afungi Peninsula, in the district of Palma, where a large gas project is being constructed. Sources cited by several online portals, including Moz24horas, claim that the attack resulted in at least one death, in addition to the destruction of material goods.—  Deutsche Welle.
