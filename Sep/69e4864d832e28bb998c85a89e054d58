Hornbill, Hoto, Ukhoro
The Hornbill is a bird with a brightly coloured downward curved beak.
The male Hornbill is larger than the female. The male Hornbill provides food to the female Hornbill. The female Hornbill makes its nest in hollow sections of trees, where it lays its eggs. The eggs hatch three to five months after incubation.

Hornbill, Hoto, Ukhoro
A Hornbill is a large colourful bird, the size of a chicken.
It can live for 35 to 40 years. They can weigh up to 6kg. It has a large curved beak, which is bright in colour. While here in Zhombe we see them, especially around Munyati River and Ngondoma Dam. While some people kill and eat them, we do not. Hornbills are useful because they kill insects which damage villagers; crops. I have never myself seen them drinking, but have seen them hoping on the rocks along the river or feeding from insects. But I like their flapping sounds.
The female lays her eggs in holes in trees so that enemies do not find them or kill its young ones. When I visited our relatives in Westlea, Harare, we were taken to Kuimba Shiri.
Kuimba Shiri is on the shores of Lake Chivero. It has many birds, from Zimbabwe and Africa.
