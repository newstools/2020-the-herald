The Herald Business leaders have warned that major shortcomings in the UK’s coronavirus testing regime are threatening to “cripple” the economy, as they also urged ministers to “get a grip” of the situation. The test and trace system has been overwhelmed by a surge in demand since the reopening of schools in England and a push by ministers to persuade more employees to go back to the workplace. There have been widespread reports of people struggling to obtain tests in recent days, and some people in England now face substantial delays in securing them as the government prioritises those most in need. Business leaders are worried about the risk of a second national lockdown if the test and trace system is unable to pinpoint local outbreaks of Covid-19. Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, called on the government to improve the testing regime “immediately” to ensure it could help all those who need it. A truly comprehensive test and trace programme is essential if the UK is to manage the virus without further lockdowns which will cripple businesses,” he said. “Continuing delays and a shortage of tests saps business, staff and consumer confidence at a fragile moment for the economy.” Business leaders are concerned that more workers will be forced to self-isolate at home while either they or their families are trying to secure tests, or waiting for results. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that at the start of September, before schools reopened, 63 percent of people in England who tested positive received their results by the end of the day after they had provided a swab. But by Tuesday that figure had dropped to just 8 percent, according to data from the government’s Covid-19 dashboard. — Financialtimes.
