The Herald CHICAGO. — Tiger Woods struggled to a one-over par 71 in Sunday’s final round of the PGA BMW Championship, looking to improve shotmaking and reduce mistakes before next month’s US Open golf tournament. The 15-time major winner and reigning Masters champion finished 72 holes at Olympia Fields in suburban Chicago on 11-over 291, the first time since the 2010 WGC Bridgestone Invitational he shot four rounds over par in an event. “I played a little bit better today, which is nice,” Woods said. “I didn’t finish the round off like I wanted to, but I played better than I did the first three days.” Woods was 2-under through 14 holes but a bogey at the par-5 15th and double bogey after finding water off the tee at the par-4 17th dimmed the thrill of his low round of the week. World number 17 Woods hit only nine of 14 fairways and just 13 of 18 greens in regulation on a course that played like a US Open layout with fast greens and dense rough. The US PGA Tour has already moved the CJ Cup from South Korea to Las Vegas in October and the following week’s event, the Zozo Championship that Woods won last year in Japan, could be shifted to a US course as well, according to multiple reports. — AFP.
