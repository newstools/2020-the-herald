The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — The South African PSL are set to announce the MultiChoice Group as their new partner ahead of the 2020/21 season. The PSL earlier this year parted ways with Absa, who ended a 16-year partnership with domestic football — 13 of which were as title sponsors of the Premiership while another three were through the Absa Cup, which is now sponsored by Nedbank. KickOff.com has received information from an impeccable source that DStv, a division of the MultiChoice Group, is set to be announced as the League’s new sponsor on a long-term deal, with details regarding the value and official name of the competition yet to be confirmed. Chairman Irvin Khoza has called a press conference at the SuperSport Studios in Randburg this evening, when it is expected all the particulars of the deal will be announced. MultiChoice, who are also the sponsors of the reserve league known as the Diski Challenge and Diski Shield competitions, recorded a profit of R1.87-billion for the financial year ending March 2020, according to their own report. While senior PSL officials could not be reached for comment, MultiChoice spokesperson Benedict Maaga simply responded: “We unfortunately cannot respond to rumours and speculation.” — KickOff.com
