In brief remarks after meeting President Mnangagwa, Mr Oyono said his team had been deployed to seek ways of strengthening already existing bilateral ties. “We are all part of the African Union and the United Nations and we already have excellent bi-lateral relations. We are here to look at areas where we can strengthen the ties and particular focus will be on tourism, mining and agriculture,” said Mr Oyono.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-507528" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-23-at-13.14.41-1.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-23-at-13.14.41-1.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-23-at-13.14.41-1-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The delegation then went into closed door consultations with Zimbabwean officials led by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo. The Zimbabwean officials included the Minister of Finance and Economic Development Professor Mthuli Ncube and Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor Dr John Mangudya. The two countries have had excellent ties since 2004 when Zimbabwean authorities helped foil a planned coup against President Nguema Mbasogo.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-507529" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-23-at-13.14.37-1.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-23-at-13.14.37-1.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-23-at-13.14.37-1-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The abortive coup was aimed at installing Spain-based opposition politician, Mr Severo Moto, as the country’s new leader. President Nguema Mbasogo has visited Zimbabwe several times, the last being in 2018 when he pledged to continue working with President Mnangagwa’s administration. President Nguema Mbasogo expressed desire to take existing bilateral ties to new heights.
