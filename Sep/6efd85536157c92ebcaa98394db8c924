The Herald TWENTY years after their blockbuster head-to-head showdown in Nagpur, Indian superstar, Sachin Tendulkar and Zimbabwe’s Andy Flower continue to fascinate the game’s followers. Tendulkar scored an unbeaten 201 in India’s first innings tally of 609/6 declared in that Test. In reply, Zimbabwe were bundled out for 282, with Flower scoring 55, before the Zimbabwean star hit 232 not out in his team’s 502/6 second innings score. The score was the second highest ever, by a Zimbabwean in Tests, after David Houghton’s 266 against Sri Lanka in Bulawayo in 1994-95. Flower’s double century was the fourth by a Zimbabwean after Houghton (266), Guy Whittall (203 not out) and his brother Grant’s (201 not out). Andy’s 232 was also the highest score ever by a wicketkeeper in Tests, bettering Taslim Arif’s 210 scored for Pakistan against Australia in 1980. Twenty years after their Nagpur showdown, both Flower and Tendulkar continue to fascinate the game’s followers. Tendulkar’s runs tally in Test cricket are considered Mt. Everest, for any player to climb, due to a lot of factors. The Indian superstar survived many injuries in his career that lasted 24 years. Starting his career at the age of 16 helped the master-blaster to feature in as many as 200 Tests and pile up 15921 runs. If Sachin’s career is to be cut into two halves, the numbers look solid on both sides. In first 100 Tests, Tendulkar aggregated 8405 runs and 7516 in the next 100 matches. There are many players who have bettered Tendulkar, at some point in their careers. Some players peaked late in their career only to fall short of Sachin’s big record. However, there are five players, including Andy, who debuted after Tendulkar’s arrival in international cricket, but ended their careers being in a better position than the Indian superstar. The other players are Pakistan’s Younis Khan, Brian Lara of the West Indies, Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka and Rahul Dravid of IndiaIn his 63-match Test career. Andy aggregated 4794 runs at an average of 51.54 with 12 centuries. He went on to claim the No.1 spot in the ICC Test batting rankings as well. After 63 Tests, Sachin had scored 4753 runs; 41 less than Flower. However, Tendulkar had played 16 innings fewer than the Zimbabwean at end of the 63rd Test match. In the same number of innings, Sachin had 5673 runs to his name leading Flower by nearly 900 runs. — Sports Reporter/Crictracker
