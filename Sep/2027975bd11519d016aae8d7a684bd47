The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent Suspended Registrar-General Clemence Masango, who is facing fresh charges emanating from alleged abuse of fuel coupons which prejudiced the Central Registry Department of over $100 000, was yesterday granted bail. Masango, who is jointly charged with his two accomplices Benjamin Makiwa, who was a transport officer in the department and Arthur Mathews, who was employed as his personal driver, were facing theft charges when they appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Murevangepo Gofa. Masango was freed on $10 000 bail, whilst Makiwa and Mathews were granted $5 000 each. Masango allegedly took possession of four pool vehicles of the Central Registry Department for personal errands at his home and farm between January last year and this year. Acting with his co-accused, he would corruptly request for fuel purporting that the vehicles were carrying out official finance and administration duties. Masango would corruptly alter and issue overstated fuel quantities beyond those that would have been approved by the departmentâ€™s chief accountant, Mr Peter Bwanya. The scam prejudiced the department of over 1 400 litres worth more than $100 000. Masango is on suspension without salary and other benefits after he was arraigned before the courts on charges of criminal abuse of office as a public officer after he allegedly instructed CMED to buy a double cab and six single cab pick-up trucks without Cabinet approval before using the vehicles at his farm. He has denied all the charges, saying the process of buying the cars started long before he assumed duty as Registrar-General and that payments were made before he assumed duty in September 2018.
