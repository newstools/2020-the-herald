The Herald THE two countries Zimbabwe will play in the AFCON and World Cup qualifiers, South Africa and Zambia, are set to meet in a friendly international next month. The match has been set for the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg on October 13. Bafana will also play against Namibia on 8 October, in another friendly, at the Independence Stadium in Windhoek. Bafana coach, Molefi Ntseki, will address the Safa NEC meeting on Saturday at Safa House, where he will present his final programme. The two proposed friendly matches against Cosafa opponents are meant to fine-tune the senior men’s national team before the two back-to-back Cameroon 2021 AFCON qualifiers against Sao Tome. Bafana welcome Sao Tome at FNB Stadium on 13 November before engaging the same opponents in the return game three days later. South Africa then take on Ghana at FNB Stadium on 25 March 2021 in the penultimate Cameroon 2021 qualifiers before completing the programme away to Sudan in Khartoum on 30 March. The Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifiers commence in May 2021. Bafana are in Group G, together with neighbours Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and Ghana. Only group winners will advance to the final round of qualifying where 10 Group winners will be drawn into five two-legged affairs to determine the five countries that will represent Africa in Qatar. — SuperSport.
