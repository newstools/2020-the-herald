The Herald Resolution plans, engagements with foreign governments and troubleshooting for producers of export goods will be a mere e-mail away if the Ebrahim Patel-led Department of Trade, Industry and Competition’s newly launched Export Barrier Monitoring Mechanism works as intended. The department launched the mechanism on Monday to respond to the barriers to trade that exporting producers and investors experience when accessing markets outside the country. While the closure of ports at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic brought trade to a near halt, the complexities of an interconnected global economy have meant that for years bureaucracy, delays and changes in policies obstructed exporters’ hopes of accessing new markets. The department said companies reporting challenges to the Export Barrier Monitoring Mechanism can expect to receive “dedicated government support, with a comprehensive resolution strategy developed for each individual barrier”. Deputy director general, Lerato Mataboge, said producers of export products operated in a challenging environment, with an average of 154,5 customs requirements placed on them. — News24.com.
