The Herald PARIS. — Cycling has been thrown into fresh turmoil after French judicial authorities opened a preliminary investigation into potential doping at French team Arkea-Samsic on Monday, a day after the Tour de France ended in Paris. Two people had been taken into custody, Marseille prosecutor Dominique Laurens said, adding that the probe was targeting a “small part of the team” and that those in custody were part of the “close entourage of the main rider”, without naming him. Arkea-Samsic’s leader on the Tour was Colombian Nairo Quintana, a two-time runner-up, and Vuelta and Giro d’Italia champion. He finished 17th overall on this year’s Tour. — Reuters.
