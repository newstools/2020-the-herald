FORMER CAPS United and Highlanders speedy forward Gabriel Nyoni has found a new home in South Africa after he was unveiled by First National Division Side Cape Umoya United Friday afternoon. Nyoni moved to the second tier following a disappointing stint with modest Absa Premiership side Maritzburg United in his debut season in the Supa Disk.
He was released during the corona virus lock down after playing 12 competitive games for the side. Cape Umoya United, who finished 11th in the just ended GladAfrica Championship, announced Nyoni their first signing as they begin preparing for the coming season. “Join us in Welcoming Gabriel Nyoni to ‘The Spirited Ones Family” – our first signing for the up-coming 20/21 #GladAfrica Championship Season,” posted the club on their social media accounts.
