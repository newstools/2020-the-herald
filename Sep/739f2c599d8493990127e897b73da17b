The Herald BARCELONA — Lionel Messi has reportedly agreed a stunning £623m contract with Manchester City as his struggle to leave Barcelona intensifies. Yesterday, the Argentina captain’s dad weighed in with Argentine TV reporting that he told Barca his son will not stay at the Nou Camp. The drama came on the same day City’s rivals, Manchester United, appeared to stand with a stronger chance of hijacking Liverpool’s move for Thiago Alcantara. Bild claims United can offer the Bayern Munich star a more important place in their side.There will be nobody to challenge Thiago for his place as the team’s deep-lying playmaker. And the promise of starting every game could tempt the Spanish to snub Anfield for Old Trafford. Messi and his father had their meeting at the Barcelona star’s house yesterday. Jorge also had his chat with the club’s board, after Messi expressed his desire to leave the Nou Camp. But, it also appears the player will be forced to stay on at Barca for one more season. The issue has divided the Catalan giants. Marce reported Barcelona’s board were still at odds over the future of Messi — with some opposed to Josep Bartemou’s approach that the Argentinian will not be sold. According to Spanish radio station SER, Messi is now not sure whether he will be allowed to leave Barcelona this summer. Scotland captain, Andy Robertson, says he doesn’t want Messi “anywhere near the Premier League”. Liverpool star Robertson, who played twice against Messi during the 2018/19 Champions League season, is keen to avoid facing the Argentinian again. “I think Liverpool have ruled out that we could sign him so I don’t want him anywhere near the Premier League and hopefully it stays that way. “I’ve played against him twice and it’s the hardest games I’ve ever played.” — The Sun/Marca/Daily Record.
