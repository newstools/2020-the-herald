The Herald Sports Reporter LOCAL bodybuilders will have something to smile about after National Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness announced a date for the annual Harare Classic. The Classic was last held in 2012. It will make a return if the application to the Sports Commission is granted. The association have been under pressure to hold, at least one competition, before the end of the year. NFZBF secretary-general, Quiet Shangai, said the Harare Classic was the only tournament possible this year. “We have put in a request to the Sports Commission and, once we are given the go-ahead, we will host the show,” said Shangai. The contest is open to participants from across the country. Participants are scheduled to take part in five categories.
