Two men whose pictures went viral over the weekend after they were incorrectly captioned as the pair who gunned down two soldiers in Chivhu on Saturday, appeared at the Harare Magistrates Courts yesterday on charges of armed robbery in Vainona, Harare. Mbonisi Ndlovhu (35) and David Zungura (29) were not asked to plead to armed robbery charges when they appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Barbra Mateko, who remanded them in custody to September 23. She told them that only the High Court could grant bail for robbery. Allegations are that on September 2, the pair with two others, went to 8 Dart Road in Vainona, scaled the precast wall, broke down a screen gate and entered the house. The four fired shots at the house owner, but being armed with a 9mm CZ pistol, he was able to shoot back. The gang retreated, the police were called and the two were arrested. Meanwhile, the eight most-wanted criminals arrested during a raid in Beitbridge recently appeared in court for their initial remand. Mussa Taj Abdul (47), Charles Lundu (47), Rudolf Kanhanga alias Tapiwa Munatsi (29), Tapiwa Mangoma alias Tapa (27), Innocent Jairosi (32), Prince Makodza (31), Liberty Mupamhanga (29) and Godfrey Mupamhanga (27) arrived at the Harare Magistrates Courts accompanied by more than 10 officers from the CID Homicide Unit. They were not asked to plead when they appeared before magistrate Mr Richard Ramaboa who remanded them in custody to September 23 and told them they had to apply for bail at the High Court. Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti prosecuted in both matters.
