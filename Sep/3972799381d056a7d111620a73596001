The Herald ANKARA. — The Chinese president said Beijing will not allow any country to control the destiny of others and act like a “boss of the world,” State-run media reported yesterday. Speaking at a high-level meeting to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the UN, President Xi Jinping said no country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others, or keep advantages in development all to itself, according to daily Global Times. “Even less should one be allowed to do whatever it likes and be the hegemony, bully or boss of the world,” the newspaper quoted President Xi as saying without naming any country, though apparently referring to the US as relations between the two economic giants are at a historic low currently. Calling for increased representation of developing countries in the UN, he stressed that the world’s largest organisation should uphold the rule of law. “They must not be lorded over by those who wave a strong fist at others,” he said. He added that relations among countries and the coordination of their interests must only be based on rules and institutions. President Xi also emphasised that the major countries in the world should lead by example in advocating and upholding the international rule of law and in honouring their commitments. “There must be no practice of exceptionalism or double standards, nor should international law be distorted and used as a pretext to undermine other countries’ legitimate rights and interests or world peace and stability,” the president said. — AA.com.
