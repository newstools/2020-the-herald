ZIMBABWE’s Sean Williams has maintained his place among the top T20I all-rounders in the world after he was placed third in the latest rankings released by the International Cricket Council. Williams, who had been in second place for the past few months, however, swapped places with Australian Glen Maxwell. Afghanistan’s Mohammad Nabi is still the highest ranked all-rounder in T20I cricket.
