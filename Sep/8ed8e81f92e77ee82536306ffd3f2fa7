The Herald LONDON. — Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood are to leave the England camp after an “unacceptable” breach of coronavirus quarantine guidelines in Iceland. The Football Association are investigating the breaches after Saturday’s 1-0 Nations League victory. Manchester City midfielder Foden, 20, and Manchester United forward Greenwood, 18, both made their senior international debuts in the game. Manager Gareth Southgate said they had been “naive” and had apologised. “It’s a very serious situation and we have treated it that way and have acted as quickly as we have been able to,” he added. “We have dealt with it appropriately. I recognise their age but the whole world is dealing with this pandemic.” According to reports in Icelandic and other media, Foden and Greenwood allegedly met two girls in a separate part of the hotel away from where the England team were staying. When asked about the reports, Southgate said: “Nothing has happened in the areas we occupy in the team hotel. “We are still getting to the depths of all the information because it was only brought to my attention only a couple of hours before training. “We had to decide very quickly that they couldn’t have any interaction with the rest of the team, wouldn’t be able to travel to training. — BBC Sport.
