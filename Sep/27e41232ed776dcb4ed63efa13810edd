The Herald BARCELONA. — Barcelona have agreed to let striker Luis Suarez join Spanish La Liga football rivals Atletico Madrid. Suarez is not wanted at Barca and the Catalans were happy to release him for free, providing he did not join certain other top clubs. The Uruguayan agreed terms on a reduced salary with Atletico after a move to Juventus fell through because of passport issues. Barcelona chairman Josep Maria Bartomeu then blocked the deal because he did not wish to sell to a Spanish rival. But, after meeting with Suarez’s representatives, the Catalan club have backed down, with the striker threatening to air his grievances to the media. Atletico will have to pay a nominal fee of no more than 4m euros for the 33-year-old, which will be based on variables such as Champions League qualification. Suarez will earn half of the 30m euros a year he was on at Barca at Atletico. The move ends Suarez’s six-year career with Barca, during which he scored 198 goals in 283 appearances and formed one third of a feared front three with Lionel Messi and Neymar. Inter Milan have completed a deal to sign Arturo Vidal from Barcelona for one million euros. “Barcelona and Inter Milan have reached an agreement for the transfer of the player Arturo Vidal,” Barca said in a statement. “The Italian team will pay FC Barcelona one million euros in variables.” After joining in 2018, Vidal played 96 games for the Catalans and scored 11 goals, helping them win La Liga in his first year in Spain. — BBC Sport.
