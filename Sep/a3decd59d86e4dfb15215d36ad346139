MDC-Alliance Harare West Member of Parliament Joana Mamombe was today issued with a warrant of arrest after she failed to attend court for trial on allegations of faking their abductions. Mamombe is being jointly charged with other MDC-Alliance members, Cecelia Chimbiri and Netsai Marova.
Their lawyer Mr Alec Muchadehama told Harare magistrate Mrs Bianca Makwande that Mamombe failed to attend court, as she was admitted at a health centre in Harare. Mr Muchadehama said Mamombeâ€™s doctors told him that she was suffering from anxiety problems and could not attend court.
