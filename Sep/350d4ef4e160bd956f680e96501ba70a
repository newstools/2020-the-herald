The Herald LONDON. — England Test cricket captain Joe Root has been left out of the Twenty20 squad for the three-game series against Australia. Root is in the one-day squad with Chris Woakes while Jos Buttler, Jofra Archer, Sam Curran and Mark Wood are included in both squads. Ben Stokes, who missed the last two Tests against Pakistan to visit his ill father in New Zealand, is left out. The three-match Twenty20 series starts on Friday with three one-day internationals from September 11. The second T20 is on Sunday. Opener Jason Roy has been left out as he recovers from a side strain but he will stay inside the bio-secure bubble with a view to demonstrating his fitness for the one-dayers. England Teams
