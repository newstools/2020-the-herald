THE Zimbabwe Open University (ZOU) is planning to establish a sugarcane innovation hub in the Lowveld.
This was said by ZOU Vice Chancellor Professor Paul Gundani during a familiarisation tour of academic facilities at ZOU Masvingo regional campus yesterday. Prof Gundani said ZOU was committed to the implementation of Education Model 5.0, which emphasizes the transformation of knowledge and ideas into national economic development.
He said ZOU, which was established in 2000 from the ZOU Act of 1999, is planning to open offices in every district in line with the concept of devolution. “We now have a staff compliment of 851 and seven faculties across the country. The University has so far opened offices in Chiredzi.
“It is also within our strategic plan to open offices in every district. Most importantly, the varsity intends to establish a sugarcane growing innovation hub in the Lowveld to fulfil Government’s thrust on heritage-based education,” said Prof Gundani. Guest of honour at the tour, the Minister of State for Masvingo Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Cde Ezra Chadzamira applauded the university for pioneering distance learning and implementing Education Model 5.0. Minister Chadzamira, who toured modern facilities at the campus, assured university authorities that he would liaise with Government land for the proposed sugarcane innovation hub.
“ZOU has done a sterling job by pioneering distance learning and churning influential people and professionals. No doubt that this university would become the nerve-centre of national economic development,” he said. “It is my sincere hope that Government will provide ZOU with land for their projects.”
