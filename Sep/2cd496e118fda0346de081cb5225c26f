The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter WONDER NGOKO was a goal-scorer midfielder at both Black Aces and CAPS United. Now, he wants to make a big difference as a coach. He will lead Come Again in the ZIFA Northern Region Division One League when football finally resumes. “We had an average team which did very well,’’ he said. ‘’The players cannot wait for an opportunity to play in the second-tier league as they worked hard for it. “I have a team of both seasoned, and young players, and I think we can survive relegation in their first year while learning the ropes. “We will then try to estabish ourselves in the second season before we challenge for honours. “I had senior players like Lenny Chikanya and Allan Dube, who played for Chegutu Pirates before, as well as Norman Jero who had seen duty at PAM United. “The football-loving people of Kadoma have been rallying behind the team and we are grateful to them and, with their continued support, we will get far.” If his forwards can learn from him, especially when it comes to heading the ball home, then they will have a good chance of surviving in the tough Division One league.
