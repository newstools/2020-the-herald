ZIMBABWE Rugby Union chief executive, Sifiso Made, says they are looking at resuming their leagues if they get the green-light to restart the games. The ZRU have written to the Government, through the Sport and Recreation Commission, to get clearance to restart games. They had already cancelled all leagues, including the top-flight and schools, for the year. However, they have renewed hope authorities will allow games to rebound. “We are waiting for further communication from the SRC. We wrote a letter to them, seeking permission, to restart the games,’’ said Made. “We are hoping that the green-light will come and we resume our league games as well as start the sevens league. “We will have a couple of approaches, to finish the unfinished leagues, as well as start our 7s leagues. “Maybe, we will adopt a mini-tournament approach. We will definitely see what strategy we will take. ‘’But, we are keen to make a rebound. “We hope the authorities will give us the green-light to start our games.” The Under-21 league had just started, when the authorities ordered the initial 21-day lockdown, due to Covid-19. Contact sport, including rugby, remain banned in the country. Meanwhile, administrators, referees and coaches have taken advantage of the lull in live games to enroll for online courses. “We have been encouraging rugby stakeholders in the country to take advantage of the Covid-19-induced break to enhance their capacity. “Administrators, referees, coaches and players have all hidden the call and I am glad that several of them have done that. “Our aim, as the Zimbabwe Rugby Union, has always to capacity build. ‘’We have always wanted to equip the stakeholders and they have taken advantage of the lull to do online courses.”
