The Herald ROME. — Italian Open tennis champion Novak Djokovic said getting back on court for a tournament so quickly after being disqualified at the US Open for striking a line judge with a ball helped him move on from the incident. The world No. 1 came in for heavy criticism at Flushing Meadows earlier this month and the Serb said he spent several days processing what had happened. He returned to tournament play in Rome last week and captured his 36th ATP Masters crown in Monday’s final by beating Argentine Diego Schwartzman 7-5, 6-3. “I did experience mentally some ups and downs in the first four-five days after that happened,” Djokovic told reporters. — BBC Sport.
