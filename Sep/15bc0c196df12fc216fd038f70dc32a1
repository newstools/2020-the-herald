The Herald KWAZULU-NATAL. — Media personality Boity Thulo has joined US star Selena Gomez and local celeb Zodwa Wabantu by releasing a fragrance, with the perfume retailing for R1 500 a bottle. The media personality took to her social media to announce her latest money move, and expressed her pride in the product called Boity Pink Sapphire. “Thank you all so so so much for the love, support and kind words,” said Boity. “I appreciate this so much. This is only the beginning!” she told fans after the launch.” In a statement Boity explained what fans can expect from the perfume. “It’s a powerful, but elegant fragrance. “The top notes you smell at first are the sugar, the fresh tangerine and wild marigold. “After a few moments, you’ll smell the amber, jasmine, and French lavender and, finally, the heavier base notes of Ambroxan, moss and cedarwood bring that incredible depth — they balance out the sweeter notes perfectly. I just love it!” Boity has expressed her gratitude for the support she’s received so far and said she’s very happy she gets to witness her family being proud of her moves. — Sowetan
