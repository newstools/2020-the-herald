The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent A self-styled prophet will perform 420 hours of community service at Kuwadzana Police Station after he was convicted of unlawful entry into his client’s house and stealing US$7 000. Steven Mururi (34) pleaded not guilty when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Victoria Mashamba charged with theft last week. Mrs Mashamba initially sentenced Mururi to 36 months imprisonment before suspending 12 months on condition of good behaviour. Another 24 months were set aside on condition that Mururi performed 420 hours of community service at Kuwadzana Police Station. Mururi was ordered to restitute the money not later than December 30. In his defence, he told the court that he was not the one who stole the money and he had never gone to the complainant’s house. Allegations were that on June 10 at No. 55 Buggard Road, Borrowdale, Mururi unlawfully entered the complainant’s room using a duplicate key. Mururi was seen by two witnesses Brian Mapuranga and Ellena Sapuhana carrying a black and orange satchel entering the yard. He was seen using the duplicate key to unlock the complainant’s door and after 30 minutes he locked it and got away. On the very date, Mururi proceeded to a car sale carrying his satchel and bought a Honda Fit using the same denominations which were stolen. An informal identification parade was done and the witnesses positively identified him. The total value stolen was US$7 400 and R4 600.
