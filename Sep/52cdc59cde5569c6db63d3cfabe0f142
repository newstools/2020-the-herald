THE Sports and Recreation Commission have lined up countrywide consultations to get input on the proposed Sport, and Recreation Amendment Bill. Sports Commission director-general, Prince Mupazviriho, told The Herald the Bill seeks to streamline and harmonise sports and recreation activities and the existing legislation. “We are currently arranging consultative processes where the stakeholders will be invited for briefing and to give their input. “We already have some platforms, where we hold quarterly meetings, with the National Sports Associations and other stakeholders. ‘’So, we will also be making use of that as well to reach out extensively. “The bill seeks to create a conducive environment, to harmonise activities and laws, with sport,” said Mupazviriho. Cabinet recently considered, and approved, principles on the proposed Sport and Recreation Amendment Bill from the Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation Kirsty Coventry. Cabinet noted that Zimbabwe currently has no legislation which regulates sport in general and that the Sport and Recreation Commission Act does not define recreation. This creates overlaps with other entities such as Tourism, ZimParks and the National Arts Council. The Bill will redress the situation.
