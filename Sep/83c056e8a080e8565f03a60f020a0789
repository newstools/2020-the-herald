The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter THE developments in football appear to have raised hope in other sport codes such as netball. The Rainbow Amateur Netball League have been in consultation with their stakeholders on how to settle the 2020 season. They are now seeing some light at the end of the tunnel. Just like football, netball was classified among high-risk sport codes, with their activities banned by the Government under the lockdown regulations. But, following ZIFA’s application for exemption to resume football activities, there is a buzz in other sectors. RANL chairperson, Melody Garikai, yesterday said this week’s developments in football, and the continued easing of lockdown restrictions by the Government, was likely to open a window for them. “We are periodically monitoring the developments and we are making consultations on the position we will take,’’ she said. “We need the input of all our stakeholders. The national executive is consulting, the regional executives also, there’s the sponsor’s input, so it’s a big group. “Right now, we are keeping our ears on the ground, monitoring what’s happening. “The developments in football, what does this mean to us, we want to stand guided by what Government is saying.’’ The league are looking at options they could consider, for the remainder of the season, which usually runs until November.
