The Herald LONDON. — English Premiership champions Liverpool have agreed a deal with Bayern Munich for Spanish midfielder Thiago Alcantara. The initial fee is £20m but add-ons could take this up to a total of £27m. Those add-ons are based on appearances and Liverpool winning trophies. Thiago will sign a four-year contract and wear the No. 6 jersey at Anfield. And Bayern Munich have confirmed that Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Thiago. The Premier League champions are closing in on a move for the 29-year-old after agreeing a €30 million (£27.2m) fee with Bayern Munich. Liverpool had initially refused to meet Bayern’s asking price but it’s understood that both parties overcame that hurdle by agreeing for the deal to be paid in increments over a four-year period. “I can confirm that FC Bayern have finally reached an agreement with Liverpool,” Bayern’s CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Bild yesterday. “It was Thiago’s great wish to do something new at the end of his career.” Jurgen Klopp is a huge admirer of Thiago, who won seven Bundesliga titles and the Champions league during his seven-year stint at Bayern. The Spain international has also attracted interest from Manchester United this summer, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side were put off a deal due to the midfielder’s wage demands. — Sky Sports.
