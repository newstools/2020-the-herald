The Herald SOUTH afriican Tourism Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane yesterday wrote letters to restaurants insisting on their cooperation with Covid-19 safety regulations after noting, with concern, some incidents of non-compliance. The minister warned in a statement that non-compliance placed the entire sector’s recovery in jeopardy. “The sector cannot risk having any of our hard-earned gains made thus far reversed as this will have a devastating impact on the recovery of the sector,” she warned in a statement. Her department has received numerous complaints from consumers, other operators and employees about the situation at certain restaurants, including that they are operating outside of curfew, offering take-away alcohol and not adhering to social distancing or the wearing of masks as required by law. “This does not only risk these businesses’ licences, but also endangers the safety of their customers and dedicated workers,” the minister warned. In an address to members, the Restaurant Association of SA also cautioned that it had become apparent that various restaurant owners believe the current regulations do not apply to them. — fin24.c0m.
