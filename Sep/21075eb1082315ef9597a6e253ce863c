The Herald Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter WARRIORS and Baroka goalkeeper, Elvis Chipezeze, says they are ready for a grand performance against Kaizer Chiefs in what could be the title-decider tomorrow. If Chiefs win at Bidvest University, and Mamelodi Sundowns don’t better their winning margin by more than three goals, they will end a five-year championship drought. “We know how important it is, as much as they want to win the league, it is also a very important game for us,” said Chipezeze. The Warriors ‘keeper missed the 1-0 victory against Mamelodi Sundowns, through suspension, and was on the bench in Thursday’s 1-4 hammering at the hands of Kaitano Tembo’s SuperSport United. Baroka are one place above basement club, Polokwane City, and need an outright victory tomorrow to have a chance of avoiding playing the relegation playoffs. Chipezeze is confident they will survive. “For now, we are just taking each game as it comes, we can’t dwell in the past because it is a different ball game now,’’ he said. “Sundowns and Chiefs, they are two different teams as much as they are fighting for the league, but it is a totally different ball game. “What happened against Sundowns is now water under the bridge, our main focus is the next match, which is against Kaizer Chiefs. “The preparations are going on very well, we are ready to go and we just have to see on Saturday and, hopefully, the boys will put in the shift so that we come out with a positive result. “As Baroka, we know what we have to do and we just have to focus.’’
