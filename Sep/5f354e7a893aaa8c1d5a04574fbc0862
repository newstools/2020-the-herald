The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWEAN professional golfer, Scott Vincent, bounced back to make the cut at the Portugal Masters at the weekend. He had fared badly in his last outing on the tour. The tournament was played at the Dom Pedro Victoria Golf Course, Vilamoura, from Thursday until Sunday. Vincent is having his maiden season, on the European Tour, after he joined from the Asian Tour at the beginning of this year. The former Virginia Tech student finished the contest at three-under par and tied in eighth place. He shared the position with Jorge Campillo, John Catlin, Julien Guerrier, Jason Scrivener and Johannes Veerman. Vincent pocketed â‚¬18,311.62. He started with a two-under 70, then had his best round of 65 on the second day before he was level par on Saturday. On Sunday Vincent closed with another two-under-par 70. The Portugal Masters featured several South Africans with Goerge Cotzee securing his fifth European Tour title. The South African produced a short game masterclass to hold off a stellar chasing pack to win by two shots.
