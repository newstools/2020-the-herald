Government in the Second Republic had generated a lot of goodwill in the West, but some countries have adopted a cautious approach and had to be convinced to denounce the sanctions against the country. The main objective of the re-engagement process, under the Second Republic is to normalise all aspects of the country’s relations with the West, and these  include ending Zimbabwe’s estrangement from the Western world, reopening lines of communication at the political level to achieve the removal of sanctions and all other punitive measures imposed on Zimbabwe to unleash the country’s full economic potential.
