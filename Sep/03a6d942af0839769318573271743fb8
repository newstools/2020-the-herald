ZIMBABWEAN all-rounder, Sikandar Raza, took two wickets at the weekend to help the high-flying Trinbago Knight Riders maintain their 100 percent winning run at this year’s Caribbean Cricket League. Raza took 2/11 as the Tridents reached 148/7 in their 20 overs. The wickets were crucial in securing TKR a two-wicket victory over the defending champions. Raza made his debut appearance in the tournament last week. His TKR sit on top of the table, unbeaten after six games. The 34-year old has featured in three games and has, so far, taken three wickets ahead of today’s clash against Jamaica Tallawahs. Raza, however, is still to make his contributions with the bat. He did not bat, in his first two games, against the Guyana Amazon Warriors. He was then run out for three run, when he got the opportunity to bat, against the Barbados Tridents at the weekend. Still, TKR managed to win the game by two wickets. Two days earlier they had beaten Amazon by seven wickets. The Zimbabwean player took one wicket in that match as Amazon were restricted to 112/7 in 20 overs. He claimed the wicket of Guyana Amazon Warriors opener Brandon King for six. However, Raza conceded 30 runs in four overs at an economy rate of 7.5 in that match. TKR are looking to reclaim the title they lost last season. Raza is part of six foreign nationals at Trinbago Knight Riders as he joins Pakistan-born Australian leg-spinner Fawad Ahmed, the New Zealand pair of wicketkeeper Tim Seifert and Colin Munro, US fast bowler Ali Khan and veteran India cricketer Pravin Tambe, who is still active at 48. The 2017 and 2018 champions, have retained 11 players, who include the Bravo Brothers, Dwayne and Darren, West Indies T20 captain Kieron Pollard, Sunil Narine, Lendl Simmons, Khary Pierre, Amir Jangoo, Tion Webster, Akeal Hosein, Munro and fast bowler Khan. The side failed to defend their title last year.
