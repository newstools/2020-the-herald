Seven men, who were celebrating birthday of a colleague at a house in Bulawayo over the weekend, allegedly attacked police officers that were sent to enforce the lockdown regulations prohibiting such parties with stones and were subsequently arrested.
Police went to the house in Old Lobengula at around 9.30pm on Saturday after they were told that more than 50 people were having a party. When the police got to the house they asked the revellers to disperse but they resisted and attacked the officers with stones.
Police later fired warning shots and arrested the seven suspects while others dispersed. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the seven were arrested for failing to obey police instructions enforcing the lockdown and reiterated that failure to cooperate with officers carrying out their duties, was a chargeable offence. “The ZRP would like to strongly warn the general public that all those who undermine the authority of the police will face the full wrath of the law,” he said. Cases of officers on duty being attacked by the public or even kidnapped are reportedly on the rise.
Last month, two police officers were allegedly kidnapped by a motorist whom they had stopped at a check point in Harare city centre meant to enforce the curfew. In 2013, six policemen on duty in Harare were kidnapped and attacked by a commuter omnibus crew they had arrested.
Police have also recorded cases of attempted murder and one culpable homicide perpetrated on officers by kombi drivers and conductors.
