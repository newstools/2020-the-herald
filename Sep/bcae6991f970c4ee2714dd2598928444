A Hwange man broke into a Catholic priestâ€™s home and stole US$1 500 before showering his girlfriend with gifts from the proceeds while on a spending spree in Victoria Falls. Admire Gwenzi (34) of 651 Baghdad in Empumalanga suburb used US$400 to buy an iPhone, two other cellphone handsets and clothes. He pampered his girlfriend with US$900.

He pleaded guilty to aggravated unlawful entry into premises when he appeared before Hwange magistrate Ms Rangarirai Gakanje who slapped him with a 24 months in jail.
