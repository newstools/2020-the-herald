The Herald Court Correspondent A police officer stationed at Support Unit, Andrew Mutuka, has been accused by his wife Netsai of neglecting his children. Netsai is now seeking an upward variation of the maintenance that her husband is paying from $300 to $6 000 This came out when the couple appeared before Harare Civil Court magistrate Mrs Tafadzwa Miti. Netsai accused her husband of being a liar and of assaulting her. “I want an upward variation from $300 to $6 000 for our two children aged 13 and 8. “He is a police officer and earns $9 500. I am a vendor and earn around $300. He does not take care of the children and if I buy anything for them he becomes violent and assaults me,” she said. Mutuka offered $3 000 and told the court that there was no reason to give her more money as they are staying together. “I can only give her $3 000 because I am the one providing for the children,” he said. “I do not know what I have done wrong. I am doing all I can for the children, but I do not know what is wrong with her. Currently I am developing a residential stand for us, but she does not see my efforts. All she do is complain every day.” Mrs Miti ordered Mutuka to pay $3 200 for the upkeep of the two children and to pay school fees for the children as well.
