The Herald Court Correspondent A security guard has been hauled before the Harare Civil Court by his girlfriend demanding an upward variation from $200 to $2 000 for the upkeep of their minor child. Zivanai Gwasha was last week accused by his girlfriend Chipo Chokufa of neglecting his child. Chokufa told magistrate Mrs Nyasha Marufu that she wanted the money to be increased because the prices of basic commodities was increasing. “I want an upward variation to $2 000 for one child aged three,” she said. “Prices of basic commodities have increased and the money he is paying cannot even buy a packet of salt. I am a vendor earning $2 000 and he is a security guard at Securico earning $7 500. He is married and he has got five more children, but two of them are above 18 years.” Gwasha offered to increase the money to $800, saying the money he was earning was not enough. “I can only give her $800 because I earn $6 000 and the money is not enough because I have five other children with my wife under my care,” he said. “After all my monthly expenses, I will be left with $1 000 which is not enough to take care of her and my family. “The problem with her is that she does not want to talk to me about anything concerning the child. So I cannot do anything to help her.” Mrs Marufu ordered Gwasha to pay $900 for the upkeep of the child with effect from end of this month.
