ZIMBABWEAN professional golfer, Scott Vincent, made the cut at European Tour’s ISPS Handa UK Championship at the weekend. The Harare-born player was part of the field, which teed off on Thursday, at the iconic Belfry, Sutton Coldfield, in England. He managed decent rounds of 67, 72, 74 and 73 for a total of two-under-par 286. Vincent had also played in the ISPS Wales Open, Celtic Classic, English Championship, Hero Open and the Betfred British Masters. His performance saw him pocketing £6 999. He will also play at the English Championship, Hanbury Manor Marriott Hotel & Country Club in Hertfordshire, from August 6-10. The ISPS Handa UK Championship was won by 19-year-old Dane, Rasmus Hodjgaard, who beat South African, Justin Walters, in a play-off. Hodjgaard also moved up the UK Swing Order of Merit title as he pipped Sam Horsefield, who won two of the six events, since the return of professional golf in the European Tour. The Dane started slowly with a 73 but then shot 69, 67 and a closing round of 65 to force a 14-under-par play-off.
