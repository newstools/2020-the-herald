The Herald Johannesburg. — The Covid-19 pandemic has forced Idols SA to scrap having an audience as season 6 is set to commence with live shows on Sunday. Aside from the contestants, the live shows of the popular music TV competition will strictly feature the Idols SA bands and host Proverb. The judging trio Randall Abrahams, Unathi Nkayi and Somizi Mhlongo will also be present. “The show is about to reach its peak, a stage where viewers are starting to have their clear favourites,” said Nomsa Philiso, the director of local entertainment channels at M-Net. “While we have had to take the difficult decision not to have audiences at the live shows due to the current environment and in trying to keep our fans and contestants safe, we are excited that our valued viewers can still enjoy this exciting production with us, from a distance, with lots to look forward to as we get closer and closer to the finale.” The top 16 for this year’s Idols SA are Ntokozo, Zama, Jerodine, Dee, Ndoni, Melanin, Bongi, Be, Qhawe, Ethan, Mr Music, Succedor, Zahn-Reece, Jooma, Brandon and Sonwabile. “This year’s competition has been an intense one for our contestants with all the changes they had to cope with in theatre week,” Philiso said. “The fate of the contestants now rests with you, the viewers at home, as they will rely on your votes to ensure that they make it to the next round, starting with our male contestants this coming Sunday.” — Sowetan.
