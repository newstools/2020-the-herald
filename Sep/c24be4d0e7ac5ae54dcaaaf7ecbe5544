The Herald Gold fell last Friday, reversing course as better-than-expected US employment data bolstered the dollar, putting bullion on course for a weekly decline of more than 2 percent. Spot gold  erased early gains to fall 0,4 percent to $1,922.71 per ounce by 10:57 a.m. (1457 GMT). US gold futures fell 0,5 percent to $1,927.30 per ounce. “Gold’s correlation with the dollar has been elevated, especially over the past couple of weeks and bullion is being weighed down by the bounce in the greenback following the solid report, especially the unemployment rate,” said Tai Wong, head of base and precious metals derivatives trading at BMO. The dollar index  was up 0,5 percent, putting it on track for its best week since early April and making the metal expensive for holders of other currencies. Data showed non-farm payrolls increased by 1,371 million jobs in August. The unemployment rate fell to 8,4 percent from 10,2 percent in July. “However, this data does not change the U.S. Federal Reserve’s stand on more stimulus to be pumped into the economy and its take on tolerating a higher inflation rate, keeping gold supported in the long run,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at US Global Investors. The metal has gained over 26 percent so far, helped by near-zero interest rates globally and easy monetary policy, especially from the Fed, and safe-haven demand driven by  a clouded economic picture due to the coronavirus pandemic. “This restive $1,900-$2,000 range should resolve ultimately higher especially with the Fed now officially elevating employment over inflation in the medium term. The practically permanent highly accommodative policy and intense election uncertainty will severely limit the attractiveness of USD,” BMO’s Wong said. — fin24.com.
