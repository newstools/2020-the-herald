The Herald LONDON. — Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s new £250 000-a-week contract at Arsenal will reportedly be announced in the next few days. The 31-year-old’s current deal with the Gunners is due to expire next summer where he would then be able to leave on a free transfer, but the Gunners have been desperate to extend his stay at the Emirates. However, The Athletic now report that Aubameyang has agreed to extend his stay with the club and will sign a new three-year deal “imminently”. The report claims that Mikel Arteta played an instrumental role in convincing the striker to stay at Arsenal. It’s also reported that the terms of Aubameyang’s deal were arranged by Arsenal’s former head of football, Raul Sanllehi, before the Gunners’ technical director, Edu, finalised the terms. Aubameyang’s new contract is believed to be worth £250 000 a week, which will make him Arsenal’s highest-paid player when Mesut Ozil leaves the club next year. Since joining the Gunners from Borussia Dortmund for £56 million in January 2018, Aubameyang has played a key role in Arsenal’s attack, scoring 71 goals in 110 appearances. Speaking after Arsenal’s victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup final last month, Arteta claimed that he wanted Aubameyang to become a focal part of his side. With Arteta opting to play one central striker, Aubameyang able to play through the middle or off the left and competition for places increasing following the arrival of Willian to rival Nicolas Pepe and Bukayo Saka, Lacazette may find first-team opportunities hard to come by. — AFP.
