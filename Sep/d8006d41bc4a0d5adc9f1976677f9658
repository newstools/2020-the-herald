The Herald Masunga (Botswana). — A Zimbabwean man who spent most of his life in Botswana has penned a book to share the odds he beat from his life journey as a herd boy to become a successful businessman. Through his book, “The Herd Boy”, Banabasi Marambire unpacks his life from the time he arrived in Botswana from his native Zimbabwe in 1994 and settled in Vukwi in North East district. Back then as a young boy, he worked as a herd boy for the Nkumane family in Vukwi who took him in upon his arrival after he shared his life story with them. In 2000, he moved to Masunga where he started a brick moulding business. Marambire’s life story depicts the boldness and resilience of a teenage boy who had the desire to fend for his siblings back home in Zimbabwe with a start-up salary of P150. Speaking during the virtual launch of the book in Masunga on Saturday, Councillor for Nlapkhwane Ward, Farai Bonyongo said there were a lot of lessons to be drawn from Marambire’s story. He said it was evident that he did not give up his dreams because of his upbringing or being a foreigner. Instead, he worked hard to become what he was today. Bonyongo said it was evident that Marambire had touched many lives in Botswana where he was raised and in Zimbabwe where he now has a construction company. He said the young man had left a footprint in Botswana having mentored many young people. — BOPA.
