The Herald Sports Reporter MOTORSPORT Zimbabwe have revealed they will not be holding national championship events this year. They will resume races, but at a club level, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The national association got clearance to train, a few months ago, and they have restarted some races under strict Covid-19 guidelines. Motorsport Zimbabwe president, Ralph Stead, said they have had to cancel all national championship events due to uncertainty posed by the pandemic. “We have cancelled all national championship events due to the uncertainty of the current situation. ‘’What we have done is we are not running the national championships this year,” said Stead. With national championships requiring athletes to travel, from one city to another, it was going to be difficult, taking into account the current travel restrictions. After a long break from competition, Stead said they were using the opportunity to get people into the sport. “However, club racing is taking place in a more relaxed atmosphere, which is encouraging new participants. ‘’It will be like club events, then we will review it again. ‘’We are using the opportunity to get people back into the sport. I think we have had three races, so far. “They are happy to be back, to be able to race again…when you run national championship, people are tense because there is pressure. ‘’But, now, it’s a relaxed environment because they know they are not going to lose points. ‘’Many people are enjoying the sport,” Stead said. Stead noted that dates for the events were subject to change, on a short notice, and there were no spectators allowed at any of the events.
