The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Khama Billiat says he is looking forward to working with new Kaizer Chiefs coach Gavin Hunt. He believes the gaffer can bring out the best out of him. Hunt replaced Ernst Middendorp at Naturena for the 2020-21 South African Premiership season. The veteran coach hopes to fire Chiefs to the league title after the bitter disappointment of their final day capitulation in the recently completed campaign. Middendorp failed to bring any silverware to the club, and seemingly caused more damage than good, by the sounds of what Billiat says. The Zimbabwean international, who managed a career-worst three goals and two assists in 25 appearances for Amakhosi last season, says Hunt has brought a much-needed new feeling to the camp. “I’ve always wanted to work with him,” Billiat told his club’s website. “We have seen with him, while coaching other clubs, that no player is ever guaranteed to play. “He’s a coach who brings the best out of you. “He makes players feel happy and that’s what we needed. You can feel it at training, there is a different energy. He made clear what he expected from me.” The Zimbabwe international says despite their last-day disappointment, the 2019-20 season has given them something to build on. “We had a good season as a team. We came so close to winning the league. It means that we have the soldiers and the capacity to succeed. “We have to challenge ourselves to do just a bit more. “A new coach will bring in different things, which is good. Challenges always bring the best out of us, players. “We all want to do better than last season.” The Premier Soccer League is expected to announce the details around the 2020-21 campaign at a media briefing this morning. —Supersport.com.
