The Herald BUENOS AIRES. — Argentina football legend Diego Maradona has undergone successful brain surgery, his doctor has said. Maradona (60), the 1986 World Cup winner, was initially admitted to the Ipensa Clinic in La Plata, Argentina on Monday, suffering from anaemia and dehydration. He was later transferred to the Olivos Clinic in Buenos Aries to undergo surgery on a subdural hematoma — an accumulation of blood between a membrane and his brain. Leopoldo Luque, Maradona’s personal physician, said he had “coped well with the surgery”. “I was able to evacuate the hematoma successfully and Diego tolerated the surgery very well,” said Luque. “The steps now are observation, but it is controlled. It will depend on how he does. It is not highly complex, but it is still brain surgery.” The hematoma was likely to have been caused by an accident, Luque added, although Maradona has said he does not remember the event. He will now remain under observation, Luque said, adding that everything was “under control”. Maradona was transferred to the Olivos Clinic in La Plata, where was operated on at 20:00 local time (23:00 GMT) by Luque, who is a neurosurgeon. The procedure took about 80 minutes. Maradona presently coaches Gimnasia y Esgrima in Argentina’s top flight. He attended the side’s game against Patronato on Friday, his 60th birthday. Supporters of Gimnasia y Esgrima have been congregating outside the hospital carrying messages of support for the former Argentina forward. Once the outcome of the surgery was announced, a group of fans outside began chanting his name, the Reuters news agency reported. His former club Napoli, who he helped to two Serie A titles, tweeted a message of support. Maradona, who won the World Cup with Argentina in 1986 and is widely considered to be one of the greatest players of all time, currently coaches local club Gimnasia y Esgrima. — BBC Sport
