The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter OUTSIDER Three To Tango was in a class of his own as he won this year’s Zimbabwe Challenge at Borrowdale Park on Friday. Coming into the race after winning the 2019 Zimbabwe Derby, Three To Tango held off a late bid from Butchie Boy and Wantage to take the 1600m Zimbabwe Challenge. Trained by Swanson Racing, and with apprentice Rodgers Satombo in control, Three To Tango got the better of favourite, Pegsson, who had been tipped to win the race despite carrying a large mass. Owned by Mr C M & Mrs E B Shepherd, Mrs K M Bonthrone & Mr J Koumides, the versatile runner has won races from 1200m to 2400m. Bridget Stidolph saddled Butchie Boy and Wantage — who both carried 54 kgs — but they had no chance.
