PREMIERSHIP newboys, Cranborne Bullets, have moved in to tie down striker Everson Feremba in anticipation of the mini-league tourney. The army side resumed full training last week after undergoing Covid-19 tests. And, coach Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera, said the preparations were going well although his players still had a lot of ground to cover. Feremba, who started his career with Gunners before moving to Mozambique, returned home to join Herentals. He then switched camp to play for Saruchera’s men, scoring some crucial goals in their campaign to get Premiership status. “We have started training and we are in our second week,’’ said the coach. “Everything is going according to plan. “We have managed to retain all our players and sorted out the issue of Feremba, whose contract was due to expire in December, and we have now taken him on a permanent basis. “We are grateful that the players are now training together and we look forward to the game when the right time comes. “At the moment, the players are still playing catch-up but most of them are in good shape as we had a programme which they followed during the national lockdown.’’ Saruchera, who has been with Black Rhinos on several occasions, took on board his trusted crew who include Milton Kureva, Nesbert Padzarondora, Yussuf Wasili, Kelvin Chiripawako, Douglas Mbewe, Obey Gada, Martin Mine and Shadreck Jimu.
