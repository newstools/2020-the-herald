The Herald Tadious Manyepo in ALGIERS, Algeria
THE Warriors were expected to leave Algiers this morning and arrive in Harare at around 7pm today. They will immediately return into the bio-bubble as they prepare for the 2021 AFCON qualifying return match against Algeria at the National Sports Stadium on Monday. They fell 1-3 at the hands of the African champions at the 5 July 1962 Stadium in Algiers last night.  The result means Algeria are now on nine points from three matches with Zimbabwe second on four. Zambia, who beat Botswana 2-1 in Lusaka yesterday, are now third with the Zebras dropping to the foot of the four-team log on one point. The Warriors know they can’t afford to lose to Algeria on Monday if they are to retain a realistic chance of qualifying for the continental fiesta which has been postponed by a year to 2022 in Cameroon.
