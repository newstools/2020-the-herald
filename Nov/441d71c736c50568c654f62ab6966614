We were surprised when the plane started making some jerks when it was turning, and then it crashed and there was a cloud of dust. We then rushed to the scene, but we could not help,” said a witness who requested not to be named. A team arrived at the scene about 20 minutes after the crash to investigate. Outside being a flying instructor, Squadron Leader Dube was the secretary-general of Chapungu FC. “He joined the club as the deputy secretary-general in 2018 before he was elevated to the post of secretary-general in 2015. His experience and commitment to football administration will be solely missed by the club and the football fraternity at large,” said the statement.
