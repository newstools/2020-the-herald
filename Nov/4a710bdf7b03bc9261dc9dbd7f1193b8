The Herald TATENDA Sunguro, a Grade Seven pupil at Chikukwa Primary School retold the March 2019 natural disaster in a way that shows how children were affected. Sunguro’s school lost five pupils when Cyclone Idai struck the districts of Chimanimani and Chipinge in Manicaland in March last year. An estimated 270 000 people were displaced in Manicaland, while 1 300 died in Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mozambique after Cyclone Ida struck. More than 12 classrooms were destroyed by the cyclone at Chikukwa. But last Friday, Zimbabwe Newspapers, publishers of The Herald commissioned a two-classroom block at the school after integrated media company heeded the Government’s call to join in rebuilding infrastructure in the districts. The commissioning ceremony was graced by Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa, who is Senator for Chimanimani, Zimbabwe Newspapers Board Chair, Tommy Sithole, Zimbabwe Newspapers Chief Executive Officer, Pikirayi Deketeke and other senior officials. Minister Mutsvangwa commended young Tatenda Sunguro for his understanding of the destruction brought about by Cyclone Ida, while highlighting the good efforts being made by various partners, who are contributing to the reconstruction in the districts. Here is Tatenda Sunguro’s poem, titled Cyclone Idai, which he recited at the commissioning: Nhaiwe Cyclone Idai Ko wakaitei? Zuva riye rawaka Kanganisa dunhu remaChikukwa Tinokatadza zuva iri Kunge pane chakanaka chawakaita Katika Makushata ega ega Wakatora neShamwari dzangu Iii Cyclone Idai woye Asi hona Zimpapers yakauya Ikatiitirawo zvakanaka Ikativakira block redu Tinotenda nezvayakatiitira.
