Michael was the eldest son of our late first President Cde Canaan Sodindo Banana. What makes Michael’s end so sad and painful is that he was already scheduled for a minor procedure to correct a heart ailment. “We remember the young Michael then for the commitment and faithful service he rendered to his country among the pioneering crop of officers of the Air Force of Zimbabwe. As a pilot, he served in Mozambique Campaign. “On behalf of ZANU PF, Government, my family, and indeed on my own behalf, I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Banana family especially to his mother, Mama Janet Banana, our inaugural First Lady. May they be consoled by our collective prayers and grief as a nation. May his dear soul rest in eternal peace,” the President said.
