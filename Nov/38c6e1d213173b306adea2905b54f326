ZIMBABWE professional golfers, Scott Vincent and Ben Follet-Smith, are part of the field which tees off this morning in the first round of the Joburg Open at Randpark Golf Club in South Africa. The Joburg Open is one of the three elite tournaments, co-sanctioned by the European Tour, with the South African Open and the Alfred Dunhill Championship being the others. Also in the field, is former Zimbabwe amateur Sean Crocker, who now represents United States. It’s been long since a local professional won a major tournament. Vincent will tee off at midday, together with Ockie Strydom, and amateur, Joe Long. Follet-Smith will tee off 30 minutes later, from the same tenth tee box, alongside former Zimbabwe Open champion J’be Kruger and Joel Sjoholm.
