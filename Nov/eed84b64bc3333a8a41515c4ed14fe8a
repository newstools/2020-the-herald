The Herald BERLIN. — Bayern Munich returned to the top of the German Bundesliga football table with an exciting 3-2 victory over rivals Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. Marco Reus put Dortmund ahead late in the first half but David Alaba levelled with a deflected shot after a clever free-kick routine in injury time. Robert Lewandowski headed in from Lucas Hernandez’s cross and set up Leroy Sane, who cut in to put them 3-1 up. Erling Haaland rounded Manuel Neuer to give Dortmund hope in “Der Klassiker” but they could not find an equaliser. Lewandowski thought he had wrapped up the game in injury time with a strike that was deflected in by Dortmund’s English teenager Jude Bellingham but it was ruled out by the video assistant referee for offside.  — BBC Sport.
