The Herald Fungai Lupande Mashonaland Central Bureau A man from Beaconhill Farm in Bindura smashed his 18-month-old son’s head against the wall, resulting in his death following an altercation with his mother and wife. Provincial police spokesperson Assistant Inspector Fidelis Dhewu said the toddler was killed on October 19 at around 6pm. He said the incident occurred when Matthew Mutore (24) and his wife, Ms Cindy Musunda (21), stopped at Beaconhill Farm to see his mother Ms Esteri Sunday (46) while on their way to Mt Darwin. Asst Insp Dhewu said Mutore got into an altercation with his mother for unclear reasons and threatened to assault her. “He was restrained and the mother sought refuge at a nearby house,” he said. “Mutore alleged that someone wanted to kill his 18-month-old son Matthew Junior and he wanted to protect him. “He became violent and started throwing stones. Mutore started assaulting his wife while the baby was strapped on her back. The baby fell down and started crying. Mutore picked the baby and his wife snatched him from him. They started wrestling for the baby and Mutore assaulted his wife repeatedly. She escaped and left the baby behind.” Asst Insp Dhewu said while Ms Sunday was running for dear life, she heard a thud and sought help from her brother-in-law, Zakaria Sunday (17) and neighbours Tinashe Makini (35) and Samson Kufamukoma (37), before returning to the scene. He said they found that Mutore had locked himself inside a hut and they forced open the door before asking him about the baby. “He indicated that he had placed the baby in a red 20-litre bucket and when they found him, he was dead and his skull was deformed,” said Asst Insp Dhewu. “They reported the matter to the police who attended the scene.” Asst Insp Dhewu appealed to members of the public not to resort to violence and to seek counselling or to approach the police for assistance.
