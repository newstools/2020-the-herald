Harare regional magistrate Mr Ngoni Nduna yesterday said the trial of Harare town clerk Hosiah Chisango, who is facing charges concerning land use, delays in roadworks and abuse of council fuel, will run from December 8 to 10. The trial was supposed to open yesterday, but the defence told the court that the State papers they were served were illegible. Prosecutor Mr Zivanai Macharaga told the court that he would serve the defence with legible papers on November 25. Chisango is also jointly accused with suspended director of housing and community services Addmore Nhekairo, who is already on remand, for illegally creating and allocating stands on an open space in Kuwadzana 3 in July last year without going through the legal process of changing land use. Some of the allegations are that he allegedly instructed a land surveyor to undertake a survey in respect of stands No. 11119-11648, which are said to be in Mufakose Township and part of Lot 2 of Subdivision B of Subdivision A of Willowvale, without verifying ownership of the land. He is also alleged to have delayed authorising the use of Zinara funds, disbursed to the city to build and maintain roads, leading to loss of  value. An audit report alleged that he was abusing council fuel. He is also being accused of sending “unwarranted and in some instance, highly confidential WhatsApp messages on formal WhatsApp business platforms, which are meant to cause unnecessary alarm and despondency”.
