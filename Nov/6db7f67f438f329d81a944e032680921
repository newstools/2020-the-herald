The Herald Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent A 43-year-old Harare man was last Friday fined $1 000 for spreading irritant hairs of a mucuna coriacea plant (uriri) on his tenant’s blankets, resulting in her developing a severe burning rash. Tabeth Rutito of Kuwadzana Phase 3 pleaded guilty to assault charges when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Charity Maunga. In her ruling, Mrs Maunga sentenced Rutito to a fine of $1 000 and if he defaults he would go to prison for 20 days. She said she took into account that Rutito was a first offender and that there was no likelihood of permanent injury. But said Rutito’s blameworthy was very high as it showed the offence was premeditated. A fine would suffice in the circumstances, said Mrs Maunga. The court heard that on October 27, Rutito had a misunderstanding with his tenant, prompting him to spread the irritant on her blankets using a plastic container. It was the State’s case that when the complainant entered her room and came into contact with the blankets she immediately reacted and developed a severe burning rash.  A report was made, leading to Rutito’s arrest. Meanwhile, a 34-year-old woman appeared in court on allegations of killing her business partner in a botched car deal. It is alleged that Manyara Loveness Togo assaulted the now deceased with fists on his chest, resulting in his health deteriorating. Togo was facing murder charges when she appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Judith Taruvinga. She was freed on $2 000 bail after the State submitted that a post-mortem report in its possession was indicating that the deceased died due to heart attack, not assault. The matter was remanded to November 16.
