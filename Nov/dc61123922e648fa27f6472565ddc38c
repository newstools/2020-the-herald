The Herald United States President-elect Mr Joe Biden is to make tackling the coronavirus pandemic his top priority following his win over Mr Donald Trump, his team says. Announcing the first steps in his transition plan, his team said there would be more testing and Americans would be asked to wear masks. He will also focus on the economy, tackling racism and climate change. Mr Trump has yet to concede and Mr Biden’s win remains a projection as key states are still counting votes. However, the Democrat is forging ahead with his plans for assuming power in January after major US networks called the election in his favour on Saturday. That reportedly also includes a slew of executive orders — written orders issued by the president to the federal government that do not require congressional approval — aimed at reversing controversial Trump policies. According to US media Mr Biden will rejoin the Paris climate agreement, which the US officially left on Wednesday. He will reverse the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organisation and he will end the travel ban on citizens from seven mostly Muslim countries. He will reinstate an Obama-era policy of granting immigration status to undocumented migrants who entered the US as children. In his first speech as president-elect on Saturday, Mr Biden said it was “time to heal” the US and vowed “not to divide, but to unify” the country. Addressing Trump supporters directly, he said: “We have to stop treating our opponents as enemies.” He and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris have launched a website for the transition. The projected election result means Mr Trump becomes the first one-term president since the 1990s. The Republican president’s campaign has filed a barrage of lawsuits in various states but election officials say there is no evidence that the vote was rigged against him. — BBC.
