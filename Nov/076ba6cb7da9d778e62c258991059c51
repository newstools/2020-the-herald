The Herald NEW DELHI. — The monetary fine for not wearing a face mask in Delhi was hiked by four times yesterday, from 500 Indian rupees (around US$7) to 2 000 Indian rupees (around $27). The move was taken in the wake of a recent surge in Covid-19 cases in the Indian capital. After an all-party meeting over the surge in Covid-19 cases, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal told media that there was urgent need for all the political parties to take upon themselves to distribute face masks among the general public. Wearing face mask has been mandatory even while commuting or driving personal vehicles. Kejriwal also appealed to the general public to cooperate and strictly follow Covid-19 guidelines, and not take the pandemic casually. He also urged the people living in the Indian capital to impose self-restrictions especially during the ongoing festive period and not venture out of their homes for celebrations or ceremonies. According to him, there were a total of 42 458 Covid-19 cases in Delhi, as more beds and ICU beds are being arranged to accommodate more patients in the coming days. — Xinhua.
