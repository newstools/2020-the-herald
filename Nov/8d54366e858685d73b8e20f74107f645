The Herald Victor Maphosa Herald Reporter A village head and a secretary at St Michele Farm in Karoi were arrested by the police recently for stealing inputs for the Pfumvudza farming programme. The village head, Rueben Muza (45) and the secretary, Shepherd Madhochi (49), are alleged to have included names of dead people on the list of villagers who were to receive the inputs. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the arrests. “The two were tasked by agricultural extension officers to oversee the collection and distribution of Pfumvudza inputs in that area,” he said. “They compiled a list of 96 people and included names of dead people on the list before they gave it to their councillor. “When the inputs came, they took all the inputs that were supposed to go to the dead people whose names they had included on the list, but information leaked to the police and investigations were carried out leading to their arrest. “They stole agricultural inputs such as Compound D fertilizers, Ammonium Nitrate, soya bean seed and maize seed. “Six bags of compound D and six bags of Ammonium Nitrate were recovered.” Meanwhile, five security officers stationed at Grain Marketing Board Mhangura depot were arrested last week for stealing agricultural inputs.
