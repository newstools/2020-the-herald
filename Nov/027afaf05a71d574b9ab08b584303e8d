NYASHA Mayavo helped MidWest Rhinos secure a 16-run win over Great Zimbabwe Patriots in their last match of the National Premier League yesterday. But, the victory was not enough to secure them the title. The Midlands side needed a big win to enhance their chances of wrestling the title from Takashinga, who had a bye at the weekend, after completing their campaign with a victory over Amakhosi last week. In the end, Rhinos settled for second place, despite finishing equal on 60 points with Takashinga. The Highfield side bagged the inaugural 45-over match title because they had a superior net run rate of 1,502 against Rhinos’ 0,698. Rhinos still ensured a close fight, thanks to Mayavo’s 50 off 61 balls, which earned him the man-of-the-match award following a 16-run victory over Patriots at Old Hararians yesterday. Rhinos won the toss and elected to bat first. However, they lost wickets frequently with opener Takudzwa Kaitano dismissed by Andre Odendaal the first ball of the match. They found themselves 37/4 by the time the 10th over came after Tarisai Musakanda (12), Remembrance Nyathi (0) and Neville Madziva (2) were all dismissed for low scores. However, Mayavo’s half century proved critical before the side was bowled out for 145 runs inside 37 overs. Tashinga Musekiwa was the second biggest contributor after weighing in with 29 runs. Rhinos, nonetheless, atoned for their batting failures with the ball. Trevor Chibvongodze was the pick of the bowlers, taking 4-31, to stop Great Zimbabwe at 129 all out, in 44 overs. The defeat meant Great Zimbabwe finished bottom of the table. The Masvingo side had one win to their credit after the eight round of the matches.
