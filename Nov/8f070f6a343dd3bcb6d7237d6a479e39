The Herald JOHANNESBURG – Orlando Pirates have had a bullseye placed on them after it was claimed that they are currently the form team in the DStv Premiership. Domestic action returns after the FIFA international break and Pirates have a date with SuperSport United at Orlando Stadium this evening (18h00). The Buccaneers come off a run of three wins in a row, as they beat arch rivals Kaizer Chiefs in the MTN8 semi-finals on either side of a victory over Bloemfontein Celtic before the disruption. Kaitano Tembo, whose side were bundled out of the knockout competition by Celtic before the break, has labelled this weekend’s encounter a “huge game” while pointing out all the positives noted in his analysis of Josef Zinnbauer’s charges this season. “It’s a huge game for both teams, I think Pirates have had a very good start to the season,” Tembo told his club’s media team. “They’re looking more hungry and they look more solid, playing with a very good work ethic and as a team, so it’s not going to be an easy game for us. “But we’ve got confidence in ourselves as well. We want to go there and give ourselves a chance, and work hard in terms of trying to match them for work ethic because they are a very good team at the moment – probably the team to beat. “But we also want to prove ourselves, we want to stay in touch with the rest of the leading pack, so this game gives us an opportunity to do that.” – KickOff.com
