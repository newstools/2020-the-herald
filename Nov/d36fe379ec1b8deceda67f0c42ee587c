Picture : Justin Mutenda “Most of them only cover their chin, leaving the mouth and the nose, which is against the regulations. This, however, poses a danger to other people and even to themselves. “Some also carry their masks in handbags and pockets and only put them on when they meet police on patrol. We will not hesitate to arrest anyone found on the wrong side of the law.” Asst Insp Chazovachii warned some transport operators who were operating outside the law that they risked having their vehicles impounded. He said most of them were operating public transport without exemption or outside the Zupco franchise and urged them to follow the normal procedures for them to operate. Asst Insp Chazovachii said police were working with other relevant stakeholders targeting such operators.
