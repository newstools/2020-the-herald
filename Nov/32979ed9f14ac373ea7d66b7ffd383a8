The Herald PARIS. — Cristiano Ronaldo continued his quest to snatch the all-time record for most international goals when he struck his 102nd Portugal goal in their in a 7-0 win over Andorra on Wednesday night. Ronaldo missed that match after testing positive for coronavirus and was introduced at half-time on Wednesday, but had to wait until there were only five minutes remaining to boost his record bid with a close-range header. Pedro Neto and Paulinho both scored on their Portugal debuts as the European champions unsurprisingly routed Andorra in a friendly on Wednesday. Neto (20) rifled in the opening goal after eight minutes while Paulinho, making his debut at the age of 28, got in front of his marker to score the second just before the half hour. Renato Sanches added the third in the 56th minute and Braga forward Paulinho headed in his second from Mario Rui’s cross five minutes later. Emili Garcia turned the ball into his own net before Ronaldo, who was rested for the first half, headed his 102nd international goal with five minutes left and Joao Felix completed the rout. Ronaldo’s goal left the 35-year-old only seven short of former Iran forward Ali Daei’s alltime record of 109 international goals. Elsewhere, Finland spoiled Marcus Thuram’s party after beating France 2-0 on the day the Borussia Moenchengladbach attacker emulated his father Lilian Thuram by making his debut for Les Bleus. Thuram was picked by Didier Deschamps for the friendly at the Stade de France over 22 years after his dad won the World Cup at the same ground, but despite a strong performance on the left wing could not stop the Finns from coming out on top. The 23-year-old hit the bar with less 15 minutes gone and soon after flashed a difficult volley over as he and Lucas Digne caused continual problems down the left flank for the away side. However, Marcus Forss stunned the hosts when he collected the ball after a Moussa Sissoko mistake and rammed home at Steve Mandanda’s near post. — AFP.
