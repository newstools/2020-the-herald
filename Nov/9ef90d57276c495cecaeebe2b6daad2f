The Herald Victor Maphosa Herald Reporter One person was seriously injured while property worth hundreds of thousands of dollars was destroyed in a fire that broke out at Chirundu Court near Divaris Shopping Centre in Belvedere, Harare this morning.  The fire, which completely destroyed the entire second floor of the City of Harare owned-double storey building, is reported to have started after a gas tank exploded in one of the apartments. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-515832" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-18-at-12.45.45-2.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-18-at-12.45.45-2.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-18-at-12.45.45-2-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />  Tenants on the building said officers from the emergency services failed to respond in time and the first truck to arrive did not have enough water to put out the fire.
