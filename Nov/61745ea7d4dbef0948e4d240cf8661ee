The Herald Midlands Bureau A 70-year-old Gweru man has been arrested for allegedly creating and selling stands on State land at Herfordshire Farm on the outskirts of Gweru for $316 000. Mugeza Hove, who was claiming ownership of the farm which was acquired by Government, last Friday appeared before Gweru magistrate, Ms Miriam Banda, facing 12 counts of theft. Hove was represented by lawyer Mr Thomas Militao and denied the charges. He was remanded on free bail to December 1. The court heard that sometime in 2004, Herfordshire Farm was acquired by Government for urban expansion. Servicing of stands was granted to private property developer, River Valley Properties, which serviced 2 000 residential stands on the farm under Herfordshire phases one and two. Hove contested the acquisition of land and lost the court case, but clandestinely proceeded to allocate residential stands to unsuspecting people before pocketing the money. It also emerged that neither Hove nor his late brother, Luke Hove, ever owned the farm. The late Luke Hove was mistakenly given an offer letter in 2009 , but it was later withdrawn.
