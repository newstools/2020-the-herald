The Herald WASHINGTON. — The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday reported a record-high average daily increase of Covid-19 cases at nearly 100 000, a new milestone since the onset of the pandemic in the country. The seven-day average daily cases and deaths have been on sharp rise recently, and stood at 99,320 and 938, respectively, as of Sunday, CDC data showed. Daily case count in the country set a new record on Friday at 132,830, which is an all-time high in the United States and around the world, according to the CDC. Saturday was the fourth day in a row the country broke its case count record, according to the COVID Tracking Project. A total of 715 000 cases were reported last week, which means that one in every 462 people in the United States tested positive for COVID-19 last week, according to the project. “Hospitalisations are also spiking in all regions, and are now close to the totals we saw in the spring and summer surges,” the project tweeted. There are around 56 000 Americans currently hospitalised with Covid-19. The fall resurgence has brought regular new records in cases, people hospitalised and daily deaths. Experts are concerned the upcoming season may witness even more infections as many people may travel and attend indoor gatherings with friends and relatives. — Xinhua.
