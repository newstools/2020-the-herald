The Herald EAGLES women captain Modester Mupachikwa scored her maiden century in the Fifty50 Challenge — and the competition’s first hundred — in their 78-run victory over Mountaineers women at Takashinga Sports Club on Saturday. Mupachikwa carried the bat for her side scoring an unbeaten 104 that came off 131 balls and had 15 fours. Mountaineers, who had already qualified for the final of the competition before this match, won the toss and chose to field in a match reduced to 39 overs after a late start due to overnight rain. While they kept their extras low, the Eastern Highlands side found taking wickets tough. Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano and Loryn Phiri were the only ones to get breakthroughs. Kellies Ndlovu was the first one to go, trapped leg before for nine — at that point, she and Mupachikwa had put on an opening partnership of 63. Soon after Mupachikwa got to her half-century, scoring 51 off as many balls. Christabel Chatonzwa was handy for her 11 in a 43-run partnership for the before Mugeri-Tiripano then accounted for her wicket with Pinky Mashonganyika completing the catch. Precious Marange continued her impressive turnout this season as she remained unbeaten on 36 when the Eagles innings ended on 177 for the loss of two wickets. Mugeri-Tiripano claimed one wicket for 26 runs and Phiri one for 29. In response, Mountaineers never really got going, losing their first four wickets inside 12 overs with only 12 runs on the board. Mitchell Mutongawafa did the early damage dismissing the dangerous Mugeri-Tiripano for 14 and Rumbidzai Nire for nought. Nyasha Gwanzura provided the main resistance, top-scoring with 22, her partnership with Audrey for the fifth wicket the highest of the innings with 36. Phiri and Francesca Chipare chipped in with 14 and 16 respectively but in the end Mountaineers could only score 99 for the loss of eight wickets from their overs. Mutongawafa took two wickets, conceding 14 runs in two overs. Marange returned one for nine and Ndlovu one for 12.
