Sports Reporter HERENTALS coach, Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva, is a relieved man after his side started training sessions ahead of the expected mini-league tournament. The coach, whose side recorded a clean bill of health, began their preparations on Thursday. “I am happy that, at least, there is a possibility that we may play the game soon,’’ he said. ‘’It was a frustrating time, which affected everyone, but I am happy that, gradually, we are going past this phase. “We have managed to retain all our players, those we had plans with before the lockdown, and there is no-one who has shown any interest in leaving us. ‘’Bringing the boys together, after a lengthy spell, was good. ‘’As a coach, I enjoy my job and I have some ambitions which can only be achieved when the sport is being played.’’ Mutiwekuziva says the scheduled mini-league tournament would be a big boost to the clubs. ‘’My hope is that the mini-league will be a good platform for the boys to impress national team coaches ahead of next year’s CHAN games. “I have belief in my boys and I know they always raise up to the occasion, like what they did last season, when we were fighting relegation,” said Mutiwekuziva.
