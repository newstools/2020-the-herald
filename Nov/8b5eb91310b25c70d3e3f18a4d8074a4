The construction of the building was expected to be completed by March next year but is now due for completion in September of the same year following disruptions that were caused by the Covid19 pandemic.
“There has been tremendous progress and achievements in terms of construction and finishing.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-517812" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/pic5.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/pic5.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/pic5-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
“I am sure the constraints came around as a result of Covid-19. I am sure there would have been far advanced compared to where we are now. Arrangements have been made for technicians who had been out of the country to come back and I believe that from next year, construction would be in full pace,” President Mnangagwa said.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-517815" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/pic4.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/pic4.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/pic4-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" />
