The Herald GABORONE. —  The executive secretary of Southern African Development Community (SADC) Stergomena Lawrence Tax yesterday encouraged member states to ensure that energy and water infrastructure is not jeopardised by Covid-19. At a time when the world is facing a great challenge imposed by Covid-19, Tax told a joint virtual meeting of Ministers Responsible for Energy and Ministers Responsible for Water that the deadly disease continues to aggressively affect the socio-economic development of SADC region. “As a region, we need to ensure that our energy and water infrastructure and services are not jeopardised due to this pandemic,” said Tax in her introductory remarks. In this recognition and with a view of being prepared, Tax said the secretariat conducted a sectoral assessment of the impacts of COVID-19 including on the energy and water sectors. Tax said the assessment did allude to the fact that there is need for member states to increase investments in the energy and water sectors so as to ensure that all SADC citizens have access to energy and safe drinking water. The 40th SADC Summit of Heads of State and Governments held virtually in August this year approved the SADC Vision 2050 and the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan 2020-2030. — Xinhua.
