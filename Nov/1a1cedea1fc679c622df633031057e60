The Herald LONDON. — Dillian Whyte has questioned why David Haye allowed Zimbabwe-born British heavyweight boxer Derek Chisora to have a set of trainers with no “boxing experience” in his corner for the defeat to Oleksandr Usyk. Chisora fell to a unanimous decision loss to the unbeaten Usyk but his manager Haye claims he is “ageing like a fine wine” and wanted him to rebound at three weeks’ notice to fight Whyte this month. “I thought Derek could have done much better,” Whyte told Sky Sports about his old rival’s performance against Usyk. “He let himself down by not having any boxing experience in his corner to guide him and tell him what to do. “He just went into the ring with a mind-set of ‘knock-out, knock-out, knock-out’ but it didn’t work and he just stuck to that game-plan. — Sky Sports.
