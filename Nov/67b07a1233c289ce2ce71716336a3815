The Herald BUENOS AIRES. — Diego Maradona has been hospitalised just three days after turning 60. The fallen football legend is in a private clinic in the Argentinian city of La Plata an hour’s drive south of the capital Buenos Aires. The official line is that Maradona was admitted to Ipensa Hospital suffering from dehydration and his personal doctor Leopoldo Luque insisted the recovering drug addict’s latest health scare was not linked to a relapse or coronavirus. Hinting the former Napoli and Barcelona star was suffering from depression, he added: “It would be wrong to say he’s just suffering psychologically. “His clinical situation cannot be separated from his frame of mind. “His psychological situation affects everything, you begin to eat badly, the amount of protein your body needs goes down. “Diego goes in cycles. Sometimes he’s okay and then he has periods when he’s not doing so well. “I didn’t like the state he was in. Getting him into hospital helps him.” A source close to the retired footballer, who now manages La Plata-based Esgrima y Gimnasia, told local press: “Diego’s really down. He’s not eating and he’s not talking. He’s missing his parents. — The Sun.
