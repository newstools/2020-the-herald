The Herald CAIRO. — Africa’s oldest footballing rivalry has an elevated prize on offer on Friday when Egypt’s Al Ahly meet their arch-rivals Zamalek in the African Champions League final in Cairo. Bitter adversaries for more than a century, Friday’s clash for the top club trophy on the continent is the 239th meeting between the two teams, each of whom can count their support in the Arabic-speaking world in the tens of millions of fans. Al Ahly dominate the past win count 102-58 but this is the first time the Cairo clubs face off in a continental competition final. The showpiece, however, faces being overshadowed by Covid-19 infections with three Al Ahly players possibly missing out, including veteran playmaker Walid Soliman. Zamalek will be without key defender Mahmoud El-Wensh, Egyptian press reports said. Al Ahly employed South African coach Pitso Mosimane just under two months ago and he has continued their domestic dominance. — AFP.
