He said culture was important as it ensured economic development for generations to come and said what was happening at Chitungwiza Arts Centre should be done across the nation and make sure the sector was productive. “My visit to this centre does bring to the fore the need for agencies such as the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe and the National Gallery of Zimbabwe to unlock the inherent value and potential of the cultural creative industries to become a formidable and robust economic sector of Zimbabwe,” said VP Mohadi.
