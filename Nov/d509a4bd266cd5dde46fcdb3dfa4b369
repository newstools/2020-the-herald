Co-accused Landiwe Ntlokoane has also been granted bail of R100 000 while accused number two in the matter has also been granted bail of R20 000. Since their arrest, the leaders of the Enlightened Gathering Church spent two weeks behind bars. Bushiri’s supporters have been gathering outside court since the beginning of the bail hearings, insisting he and his wife have done nothing wrong. — EWN.
