The Herald Sports Reporter A NEW-look Mighty Warriors will get down to business at the COSAFA Championships this afternoon when they play Tanzania at Wolfson Stadium in Port Elizabeth. The Zimbabwe senior women’s team will field a relatively youthful side. A number of seasoned players like Marjoury Nyaumwe, former skipper Felistas Muzongondi, Chidzo Dzingirai, Kuda Basopo, Erina Jeke and Rudo Neshamba have been overlooked for this tournament. ZIFA opted to have the Under-20 team, which is involved in the World Cup qualifiers, to travel to South Africa. They brought in some veterans to bring in the experience. Midfielder Emmaculate Msipa will captain the team. Msipa, forward Rutendo “Madzimai” Makore, Sheila Makoto, Danai Bhobho and Mavis Chirandu are the only senior players, who went to the 2016 Olympics, in the team. The women’s regional tournament got underway yesterday with  South Africa beating Angola 2-0. Earlier in the day, Eswatini came from behind to beat Comoros 4-2. Before their departure to the Eastern Cape on Monday, Mighty Warriors coach, Sithetheliwe “Kwinji 15” Sibanda, said they were not under any pressure. “We are going there without any pressure but the objective is to have exposure for the team, especially to the youngsters coming up into the team,’’ she said. “Of course, the players are not fully fit but I think the fact that they missed football will push them to give it their all.’’ Yesterday team manager, Tafadzwa Bhasera, said the players were excited to finally play football after seven months of inactivity. “We managed to get time to train, although it was limited. So far, everything is under control and the girls are ready to showcase, especially the first timers. “The weather is unfriendly, though, but because of the waves, we are fine,” said Bhasera. The Under-17 women’s team also arrived in Port Elizabeth yesterday ahead of their tournament, which gets underway this afternoon.
