The Herald Court Reporter AN equipment manager at Mingchang Sino Africa Investment, a gold mining company, sold himself out on social media when he requested to know how he could smuggle stolen gold worth US$23 000 out of the country. Tan Juncheng (34), a Chinese national who also doubled as reduction manager at the same company, asked his friends and workmates how he could smuggle 400 grammes of gold. Tan was taken to Harare Magistrates Court charged with theft and as not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before magistrate Mrs Victoria Mashamba. He was remanded in custody to October 19 for routine remand. Prosecutor Ms Stylone Marufu said from March to October 3 this year, Tan stole 500g of gold. The court heard that during that period, he took advantage of his position as reduction manager and being in charge of gold processing up to its smelting to steal the precious mineral. It is alleged that during that period, Tan would allegedly steal gold in small quantities. The court heard that he later took pictures of himself holding the gold and posted them on social media enquiring how he could smuggle it out of the country. He would also allegedly sent the same pictures to his workmates, saying he was in possession of some gold. The alleged offence came to light on October 3 when some of his workmates informed Mr Hui Zhang, the companyâ€™s development department manager. Reports from investigations also revealed that gold production was going down, according to the State.
