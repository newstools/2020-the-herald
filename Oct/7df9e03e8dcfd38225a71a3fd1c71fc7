The Herald Crude oil prices took a nosedive last Friday after President Donald Trump tweeted late on Thursday that both he and the first lady had tested positive for Covid-19. Brent crude slipped below $40 in Asian and European trading, and West Texas Intermediate stayed below $38 a barrel, after falling earlier this week. Oil was already on the decline earlier this week, weighed down by renewed fears about demand recovery as new Covid-19 cases continued rising fast in Europe, the US, and India. The global total passed 34 million this week, up by a million from a week earlier. The death toll from the disease passed the 1-million mark this week as well. In more bearish news, the US Congress continued failing to strike a bipartisan deal on further financial stimulus. The only development in this direction was the House approving a Democrat-proposed bill for an additional $2,2-trillion in stimulus that is likely to hit a wall in the Senate. â€” Oilprice.com.
