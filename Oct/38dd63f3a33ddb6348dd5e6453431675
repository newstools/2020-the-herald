The Herald FORMER Polokwane City forward, Walter Musona, is being assessed by South African Premiership side Baroka FC. The younger brother of ex-Kaizer Chiefs star and Zimbabwe national team skipper, Knowledge, was part of the Rise and Shine team that was relegated to the GladAfrica Championship last season. Musona played 14 matches for Polokwane in the last campaign, scoring one goal. “I’m training with Baroka FC now, at the moment I’m still just training,” Musona told KickOff.com. “I’m not sure for how long or for how many days but I’m training there. But yeah everything is okay this side. I hope I sign because I need to play in the PSL.” The 24-year-old Zimbabwean, who can also play as a left-winger, joined Johnny Mogaladi’s side from FC Platinum in 2017 following a stint with Slovakian football club FK Senica. The 24-year-old Walter was recently released by Polokwane following their relegation and is now a free agent. Polokwane, who had three Zimbabweans on their books, are streamlining their budget and have sought to reduce their wage bill. Giant goalkeeper, George Chigova, has since joined SuperSport United, while Charlton Mashumba’s future at Rise and Shine is still unclear. Musona is hoping to give fresh impetus to his stint in South Africa, after failing to reach the heights set by his brother. Baroka, who are also based in the Limpopo province, are also home to Zimbabwean goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze. Bakgaga assistant coach Matsemela Thoka is in charge of the training sessions following the suspension of head coach Dylan Kerr. — Sports Reporter/Kickoff
