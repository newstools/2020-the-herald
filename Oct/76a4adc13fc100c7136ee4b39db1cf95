The Herald LONDON. — World Athletics president Sebastien Coe said competitors should be able to “take the knee” on the podium at the postponed Tokyo Olympics, following an outcry over moves to ban protests. Coe, who was inspecting the national stadium where Olympic track and field will be contested next year, said any protests must be carried out with “respect” for other competitors. A ban on demonstrations at the Olympics, issued in January, has come under extra scrutiny since the Black Lives Matter movement flooded sports following George Floyd’s death in US police custody in May. “I’ve been very clear that if an athlete wishes to take the knee on a podium then I’m supportive of that,” Coe told reporters in Tokyo. “The athletes are a part of the world and they want to reflect the world they live in,” he added. “And that is for me perfectly acceptable, as long as it is done with complete respect for other competitors, which I think most athletes properly understand.” The International Olympic Committee issued updated guidelines on athlete activism in January, outlawing any kind of demonstration on the medal podium or field of play. But it has hinted it may be willing to soften its stance and is backing discussions led by the Olympic Athletes Commission to consider ways of allowing “dignified” support for anti-racism initiatives. In June, US athletes and 1968 Mexico Games icon John Carlos, who was famously kicked out of the event for raising his fist in a black power salute, called on the IOC to scrap the ban on protests. And he pointed to the two new world records set overnight in Valencia, in the 10 000m and women’s 5 000m, as evidence that athletes were raring to go. — AFP.
