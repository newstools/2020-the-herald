The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter AFTER the demise of the Airport Airways chip and putt nine-hole golf course due to viability challenges, Royal Harare will soon introduce a new six-hole par-three links course. The six-hole layout, a first of its kind in Zimbabwe, will provide hours of fun for Royal members and visitors. Ian Mathieson, the general manager of Royal Harare said the move will bring a challenging and exciting, new golfing experience. “The links will provide an ideal opportunity for experienced golfers to fine-tune their short game, and for new golfers, it will offer a perfect introduction to the game. ‘’The emphasis will be on providing a professionally-run, fun-filled, relaxed environment for golfers, old and new, and their families, to experience the wonderful game of golf. “The links will also provide a great venue for company team-building functions, or corporate events, and in phase two, early in 2021, there will be a new clubhouse with a deck overlooking the entire links course.’’ Professional golfer, Ryan Cairns, who is the director of Golf at Royal Harare, has some exciting tournaments on The Links planned for 2021. The links course is due to open in mid-November and will operate daily from 06:30am, and, once conditions return to normal, will remain open, under floodlights until 10pm. Initially the links will close at 6:30pm, in compliance with current operating hours guidelines. The course can accommodate up to 144 players per day, playing in fourballs in flights of six tee times, per session. Royal is well known for the quality of its greens, and the Links greens, once fully established, will compare equally with the greens on the main course.
