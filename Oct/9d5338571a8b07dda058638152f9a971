The Herald LONDON. — Fabinho’s injury is “exactly the last thing we needed”, said Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp after seeing the club’s defensive problems mount during the Champions League football win over Midtjylland on Tuesday night. The Brazilian joined Virgil van Dijk and Joel Matip on the sidelines after pulling up with a hamstring injury during the 2-0 Group D win at Anfield. Midfielder Fabinho has been filling in for Van Dijk in the centre of defence since the Netherlands international suffered a serious knee injury in the Merseyside derby against Everton on 17 October. “He felt his hamstring, and that’s not good,” said Klopp when asked about Fabinho’s injury after the Reds went two points clear at the top of Group D. “He said he could have played on but no sprints, which doesn’t help. We will see, we will know more after a scan but clearly it isn’t good.” Nineteen-year-old Rhys Williams, who was on loan at National League North Kidderminster Harriers in the sixth-tier of English football last season, was sent on to partner Joe Gomez at the back. “We’re doing really well but it’s a shock for a team because now we have to sort that injury,” added Klopp. — BBC Sport.
