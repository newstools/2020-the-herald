The Herald The Spur Corporation has reported its best month of sales since lockdown restrictions were relaxed to allow sit-down restaurant service at the end of June. In a trading update yesterday, Spur said its SA restaurants traded at 73,8 percent of last year’s turnover for September, an improvement from just 36,5 percent for July and 56,7 percent for August. Spur owns Spur Steak Ranches, Italian food franchise Panarottis, seafood restaurant John Dory’s, burger joint RocoMamas and steak restaurant Hussar Grill. The strongest performing brands for September were The Hussar Grill at 93,7 percent of
last year’s turnover, and RocoMamas at 86,5 percent. Spur has been beset by leadership changes in recent months with its Chief Executive Officer Pierre van Tonder announcing his retirement, while Chief Operating Officer Mark Farrelly and Chief Financial Officer Phillip Matthee both announced their resignations. Outgoing CEO Van Tonder, in a statement, said the recovery in restaurant turnover had “exceeded management’s expectations”. “The improving monthly growth trend is particularly encouraging in the tight consumer environment where spending is under intense pressure.”— news24.com
