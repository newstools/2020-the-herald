The Herald The Zimbabwe Mining and Smelting Company (ZIMASCO) , says it has instituted measures to protect its workforce from the novel  coronavirus ahead of the re-opening of its chrome smelting plant in  Kwekwe, the Midlands province. The company, which has 450 full-time employees and 500 contract  workers, halted production in April after Covid-19 affected its major markets  in Europe, Asia and China. China, among others have since eased the lockdowns. Zimasco Kwekwe general manager Namatai Mapfumo and group health and  quality assurance manager Bright Chitiki, told the media during a tour of  the plant that they were not leaving any loopholes in implementing Covid-19 guidelines and regulations outlined by the Government and the  World Health Organisation (WHO). Four Zimasco workers tested positive to Covid-19 during tests conducted  ahead of re-opening.  The company has drafted a Covid-19 safety and health policy document as  well as set up a Covid-19 response team. “As we restart operations, we have put in place measures to mitigate  the spread of Covid-19 at our different workplaces starting from the  homes of our workers,” said Mr Mapfumo. — New Ziana
