The Herald Robson Sharuko Senior Sports Editor ENGLAND-BASED footballers, Marvelous Nakamba and Tendayi Darikwa, have reiterated their full commitment to the Warriors cause with later saying his appearance, at the 2019 AFCON finals, is one of the highlights of his career. The duo paid a courtesy call on the Zimbabwe Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Christian Katsande, at Zimbabwe House in London, this week. The two also committed themselves to playing key roles in several development initiatives in this country. Midfielder Nakamba is the only Southern African footballer, playing in the English Premiership, where he plies his trade for Aston Villa. Defender Darikwa, a pioneer member of the British Brigade who have been committing themselves to representing the Warriors, is on the books of Championship side Nottingham Forest. Reports had claimed Nakamba was set to leave England, just a year after arriving at Villa, to join Turkish giants, Galatasaray, during the transfer window, which closed on Monday nights. However, the Warriors midfielder remains at Villa, with manager Dean Smith showing confidence in his qualities, despite another huge investment by the Birmingham club, into new players. The arrival of England midfielder, Ross Barkley, was viewed by some analysts as the cue that Nakamba could be off-loaded, given the huge number of midfielders in the team, but Smith appears to have stuck with the Warrior. While Barkley was fast-tracked into the starting XI, for the match against Liverpool on Sunday, Nakamba retained his place on the bench as cover for defensive midfielder, Douglas Luiz, of Brazil. Smith even threw Nakamba late into the match, with Villa on course to a stunning 7-2 victory, which has continued to send shockwaves across the football world. “I remember a certain team narrowly avoiding relegation in 2015 going to win the Premier League the next season,” former England captain, Gary Lineker, who is now the host of BBC Match of the Day football programme, tweeted after the match. “All the talk will be about Liverpool, but this is Aston Villa’s day. They were absolutely outstanding all over the pitch. Well played.” While English Premiership clubs can still continue to buy, sell and loan players with other teams in the Championship, League One and League Two until 5pm, on October 16, the closure of the window on Monday means Nakamba cannot move outside England, as reports had suggested. The Warriors midfielder was accompanied by his manager, Munyaradzi Joseph Taderera, when he made the courtesy call on Ambassador Katsande. “This week, two Zimbabwe Warriors and international footballers, Me Tendayi Darikwa, who plays for Nottingham Forest, and Mr Marvelous Nakamba, who plays for English Premiership club Aston Villa, paid a courtesy call on His Excellency (Rtd) Col CM Katsande at the Zimbabwe House in London,’’ a statement from the Embassy read. <img class="wp-image-509667 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/T-Darikwa.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/T-Darikwa.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/T-Darikwa-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> PROUD WARRIORS. . . Zimbabwe international footballers Tendayi Darikwa (left picture) greet the country’s Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Christian Katsande, at Zimbabwe House in London this week, where the duo reiterated their commitment to the national team’s cause and helping in various development initiatives in the country “The players also took the opportunity to process their applications to renew their passports in preparation for the forthcoming African Cup of Nations qualifying matches. “Mr Tendayi Darikwa was accompanied by Team Zimbabwe CEO, Mr Marshall Gore, while Mr Nakamba was accompanied by his manager, Mr Munyaradzi Joseph Taderera. “During the courtesy calls, they discussed opportunities in sports development, and the role that Zimbabwe professional footballers, can play in promoting Zimbabwe tourism and grassroots football. “Mr Darikwa expressed his appreciation for being selected to represent Zimbabwe at the last African Cup if Nations in Egypt last year. “He stated that, in order to give back, he was keen to support the development of grassroots football and empowerment of the youth in Zimbabwe. “Mr Nakamba informed the Ambassador that he had established the Marvelous Nakamba Foundation focused on assisting the youth.’’ During their discussions, the ambassador urged the players to explore opportunities in partnering wildlife conversation efforts, especially utilising the Community Areas Management for Indigenous Resources which empowers local communities in such areas like Hwange and Victoria Falls. “He encouraged them to also look at opportunities, including coaching exchange programmes,’’ the statement read. “He invited them to invest in the various sectors and activities in Zimbabwe. “Ambassador Katsande praised the Warriors for flying the Zimbabwe flag. “The Ambassador also expressed his appreciation for their commitment to represent the country, raising awareness and image building of Brand Zimbabwe. “He encouraged them, and fellow footballers, to utilise the incredible tourism resorts, and facilities, during their off-season, in order to put Zimbabwe in the spotlight.’’ The Warriors are scheduled to play a friendly international against Malawi in Blantyre on Sunday and, last night, Sports and Recreation director general, Prince Mpupazviriho, told ZBC there was a huge possibility the team will be given clearance to travel for the match. It’s unlikely both Nakamba and Darikwa will be available for that match. Nakamba, just like his Villa teammates, are basking in the glow of their sensational demolition of champions Liverpool, the first time, since 1963, when the Reds have conceded seven goals in a league match. “Now a lot’s been said of Jack Grealish’s unplayable performance and the brilliance of Ollie Watkins and Ross Barkley — yet Smith pulled off one of the best tactical master classes in modern-day football,’’ Ashley Preece, the Birmingham Live Villa specialist writer, noted in his analysis yesterday. “It all came together for Smith on Sunday evening. “He must have walked through his front door that very night, dropped his car keys on the kitchen work surface, flicked off his shoes and grabbed a bottle of beer knowing he’s onto something here. “Just mentioning this summer’s business showcases just how far Villa have come. “If you didn’t know it’s 10 weeks and two days since Villa survived by the skin of their teeth at West Ham. “In that time Smith has built a vibrant Villa side that’s capable of taking on the best there is and supporters of other clubs and pundits alike should start to take Smith far more seriously than they have done previously.’’
