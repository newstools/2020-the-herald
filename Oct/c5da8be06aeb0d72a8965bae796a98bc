The Herald LONDON. — Cristiano Ronaldo will miss Juventus’ Champions League football match against Barcelona next week after returning another positive coronavirus test. The Portuguese superstar picked up the virus last week just days after playing for Portugal against France and Spain and posing for a team photo at dinner — forcing him into a period of quarantine and ramping up fears that he would miss the club’s huge clash against the LaLiga side. But the 35-year-old has tested positive yet again, according to Spanish outlet Marca, ruling out a mouthwatering reunion with his old rival Lionel Messi. A report from Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha claims Ronaldo’s test gave a very low viral load despite returning positive, with Juventus not giving up hope completely of their talisman featuring in the game. It claims that the club will ask UEFA for permission to test Ronaldo 48 hours before the game on October 28. It will be up to the European football body to decide whether or not to allow such a request to go ahead. According to UEFA protocol, a player must test negative at least one week before a match to be considered for selection. Ronaldo and Messi, who have battled for the honour of world’s best player for over a decade, have not faced each other in the Champions League since the semi-final between Real Madrid and Barcelona in the 2011-12 season. — Daily Mail.
