Senior Lifestyle Writer The graduation season is upon us. But the happy season comes at a time many students had lost all hope of graduating, as the Covid-19 pandemic stalled everything, including education. Even after struggling to complete their studies, the students still find out they cannot enjoy that big ceremony where everyone gathers and is capped by the university chancellor. This realisation has invoked the creativity in the students, which ensures that even if they do not gather in large numbers, they still have a feel of what the day could have been. It all started with lobola and weddings where couples became innovative holding the ceremonies virtually to ensure kith and kin were involved. Now, graduation ceremonies, too, are being held virtually, with groups of students putting a lot of effort to plan for this special day. With universities following Covid-19 World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, only PhD, Masters and Class 1 undergraduate degree holders are attending ceremonies hosted by universities, as numbers are limited. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-513132" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/3010-1-1-CLASS-2020-GOLD-GRADUATION-3D-LOGO-WITH-BLACK-RIBBON_159609-20.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/3010-1-1-CLASS-2020-GOLD-GRADUATION-3D-LOGO-WITH-BLACK-RIBBON_159609-20.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/3010-1-1-CLASS-2020-GOLD-GRADUATION-3D-LOGO-WITH-BLACK-RIBBON_159609-20-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Even though, some students still feel Covid-19 has robbed them of their memorable graduation, but many are excited to plan for their day in their own special way. With thousands of students graduating, the question is: what will happen with the rest who cannot make it to the main graduation event? A survey by The Saturday Herald revealed that people have adjusted to the new normal way of life under Covid-19 restrictions. Students who are graduating virtually have been told to wear their graduation gown, dress properly and sit in the comfort of their homes while following the proceeds. Those who had existing study groups during university days go an extra mile to host parties and have been doing so in style. Some students who are planning their virtual graduation and parties said regardless that the global pandemic has affected them, they will go an extra mile to dress, eat and dance. Students like Munyaradzi Pundo shared their tips on how to host the virtual graduations to parties. “We are happy that 2020 is finally over,” he said. “At first we were affected when the lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus was announced. We were wrapping up our studies and now our university told us that we can’t attend the graduation ceremony because of the limited numbers. “We haven’t lost hope because we are organising a virtual ceremony with my 10 friends in Haig Park.” Pundo, who is a development studies student with one of the local universities, said all was set for their virtual event, and this time around it was much easier as they were organising it for themselves. “For a memorable event, you should organise a photo shoot first,” he said. “You must get together with friends and hire a professional photographer, wear your best outfit just like you would have done, then don your cap and gown.” Pundo said they hired a tent and did a mini decoration. From a large television set, they will watch the event which will be live-streamed. Chantell Zaranyika, a 25-year-old, recently graduated with a Bachelor of Business Studies. Her virtual party, she said, was exciting, though she preferred being at their university for the actual ceremony. “I would have loved to be capped by His Excellency President Mnangagwa had I scored a Class 1 degree,” said Zaranyika. “I would have loved to take pictures with my lecturers and university vice chancellor because it is just like a wedding. “It happens once. You can graduate years again, but that first cut is the deepest. However, we enjoyed the moment with my family, watching from television. We hosted a graduation dinner and dressed up.” Zaranyika said the lack of a real graduation ceremony serves as both a reminder of the impact of Covid-19 and the challenging road that lies ahead. A Zimbabwe Open University student who identified herself as Betty said they will be graduating virtually on November 13. “My six friends and I have been taking this seriously,” she said. “We bought matching T-shirts, printed Çlass of 2016’, jeans and dresses which we will wear on the day. We also found a beautiful venue at Palm Estate in Borrowdale. We cannot be at the main ceremony, but want our virtual one to be memorable. “We will have our nails, hair and make up done, eat good food and just have fun. We bought a themed cake for the day and can’t wait. We worked hard over the past four years and we cannot allow Covid-19 to stop us from celebrating our success. We planned for this from the day we started our programme and cannot abandon our plans because of Covid-19.” The graduation season has been a busy one for event managers, designers, bakers, caterers and chefs. With more virtual graduation ceremonies coming, there will be a high demand for services as students try to outdo each other when they share pictures of their side events. Local cake boss and events planner guru, Pauline Likongwe of Wedding Gallery, said despite Covid-19, this year’s graduation season had been busy. She said Covid-19 brought with it new opportunities from graduating students who all wanted unique cake designs for their virtual parties. “So far since the graduation season began, I have baked about 45 cakes, getting different orders from students,” said Pauline. “I sometimes get invited to come and help plan the event. Some students are going an extra mile to make their graduation day memorable and will ask for television sets, among other utilities.” African-wear fashion designer and former television presenter Lindiwe Majoni said with the virtual graduation ceremonies, many students were no longer worried about what they would wear on the day. “I can say it is a blessing to us designers compared to last year,” she said. “Remember, some graduation ceremonies require a certain particular type of dressing. I specialise in African themed attire, but most universities require students to be formally dressed in plain dark colours. “Now, I have made more than 118 colourful attires which will be hidden under the gowns. Since the students will be at their respective homes, they are dressing up the way they want.” Although Covid-19 affected business, it has brought out creativity and survival skills among graduating students, who still long to experience that feel of the day. Event host, Nomia Phiri, also known as ‘Phil’, said they were already booked until December 28, as students celebrate completing their studies. “My job is to link people with venues and this graduation season, it has been hectic because of different clients who want different venues,” she said. “Some of the venues have been closed because of Covid-19. We are designing makeshift venues and organising the event for the students so that they celebrate their day in peace.”
