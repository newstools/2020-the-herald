The Herald Herald Reporter President Mnangagwa is this morning attending a virtual summit on the review of state enterprises and parastatals ownership model at State House in Harare.

Officially opening the summit, President Mnangagwa noted that the review of the ownership model comes in the wake of the need to overhaul parastatals and state enterprises for greater efficiency and role, in line with goals of Vision 2030. He stressed that the review has to take into account Zimbabweâ€™s unique situation, principally that wrought by illegal sanctions. The summit is meant to acquaint Cabinet Ministers with issues around re-modelling parastatals and State Enterprises for the realisation of national goals and interests. Zimbabwe has over 107 state enterprises and parastatals spread across strategic areas.
