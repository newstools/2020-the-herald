The Herald LONDON. — Mesut Ozil has been dumped from Arsenal’s 25-man Europa League football squad — after saving club mascot Gunnersaurus from extinction. And the £350 000-a-week German is almost certain to miss out again when the club submits their  squad to the English Premier League in 10 days. That means Arsenal’s highest-paid player could have played his final game for the club — despite having another eight months of his Emirates contract to run. Arsenal’s Europa League squad was submitted to Uefa on Tuesday night, just hours after Ozil announced on Twitter he would pay the wages of Gunnersaurus mascot Jerry Quy, who has been made redundant by the club. The summer signings of Thomas Partey, Willian, Gabriel Magalhaes, Pablo Mari, Cedric Soares and Alex Runarsson have left manager Mikel Arteta spoiled for choice. But he is only allowed to register 25 players over the age of 21 — and at least eight of them must have served their apprenticeships with an English club. Now Arteta has taken the ruthless decision to omit Ozil after the club failed to negotiate a pay-off  to get him off the wage bill. It looks like Ozil is on the scrapheap after failing to kick a ball for the club since the 1-0 win against West Ham on March 7. And although he will be expected to continue training, it means his only hope of playing again this season is to sign for a club in the EFL or rip up his contract by mutual agreement and leave as a free agent. Ozil could still be registered by Arsenal after the close of the  January transfer window but it is highly unlikely as it appears Arteta has decided to move on without him. — The Sun.
