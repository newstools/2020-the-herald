Caledonia remains on track to achieve its production target of 80 000oz by 2022. Commenting on the latest production figures Caledonia chief executive officer Mr Steve Curtis said: “The production of 15 164oz in the third quarter is a record result and is an increase of more than 11 percent compared to the corresponding quarter in 2019.” Despite the negative effect of the Covid-19 pandemic on supply chains and operating arrangements, Mr Curtis said Blanket Mine has delivered robust production results for the first nine months of 2020. “Due to strong production, I am delighted that we are now able to increase our production guidance from 53 000 to 56 000oz to 55 000 to 58 000oz,”  he said. “Along with the increased dividend, this really demonstrates the strength of our business and I would like to thank the team for this result,” said Mr Curtis. Meanwhile, Caledonia has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Government so that the firm can boost investment and production in its local gold mining operation and play a leading part in the drive to a US$12 billion mining sector economy by 2023. In the MoU, Caledonia declared and affirmed its intention to increase gold production in excess of 500 000oz, around 15,5 tonnes by 2030.
