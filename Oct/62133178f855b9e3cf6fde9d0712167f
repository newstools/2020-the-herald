The Herald LONDON. — Arsene Wenger admits Mesut Ozil lacks discipline — but has offered some advice to Mikel Arteta on how to get the best out of the Arsenal outcast. Ozil has not played for the Gunners since March, and the midfielder suffered a further blow this week when he was left out of Arteta’s Europa League football squad. With his contract due to expire next summer, the former Germany international’s Arsenal career could well be over — although he will focus on trying to earn a recall in the Premier League and Carabao Cup. But Wenger — who brought Ozil to the Emirates in 2013 — believes the 31-year-old can still an effective weapon with the right structure around him in the team. “He wasn’t exactly the one with the greatest discipline on the pitch,” the legendary ex-Gunners boss told Der Spiegel, and playing the game without the ball wasn’t exactly his forte. “But you can deal with that if you put some more defensively minded players by his side. The main thing is to get the balance between attack and defence right.” Wenger’s claim suggests that Ozil could benefit from Thomas Partey having joined Arsenal on transfer deadline day. Partey was regarded as one of La Liga’s finest defensive midfielders during his time with Atletico Madrid, and has been signed by Arteta to help give the Gunners the solidity they have lacked in recent seasons. So if Ozil can force his way back into Arteta’s thinking, the extra protection offered by Partey could afford him the freedom to play with the attacking flair he has shown in the past. However, Wenger warned that the game has moved on since Ozil was at his best — hinting that the midfielder may have been left behind by developments. — The Daily Star.
