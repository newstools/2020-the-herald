The Herald Sports Reporter A UNITED STATES-based Zimbabwean, Gideon Kanyongo, has encouraged football scouts to look beyond urban areas and cast their nets into the rural areas where there is vast talent. Kanyongo has introduced an annual community football tournament in Mutoko in honour of his late father. And, he believes there is raw talent in the rural areas, which scouts should consider assessing. He has since enlisted the services of veteran coaches, David “Yogi” Mandigora and Laban Kandi to visit the venue of the ongoing two-week tournament, which ends on Sunday. He wants the duo to look for potential future stars. Speaking from his US base, Kanyongo, who grew up playing football, but decided to pursue engineering, said the tourney will grow to become a national event in the coming years. “We believe there is talent in the countryside and scouts should consider spreading their wings for the good of Zimbabwe football,” he said. “We are hosting the inaugural tournament in Kanyongo Village in Mutoko. “The fiesta is in honour of our late father, who was a headmaster, but his heart was in football. “The tournament will be held every year and the ongoing inaugural tournament has seven teams participating. “Mandigora and Kandi will watch the semi-finals and the final and they will scout for good players from the tournament.” The tournament has been dubbed the KB Kanyongo Invitational tourney. Kanyongo, Karonga, Chingondo, Dip, Gumbure, Star City and Mazengera are all battling for the honours in this tournament. Winners will walk away with a trophy, and medals, as well as some cash prizes. All other participants will get appearance fees. The goalkeeper, player and top-scorer of the tournament will be honoured. Besides sponsoring the football tournament, Kanyongo is supporting about 70 households with monthly groceries. Orphans and other disadvantaged members of the community benefit from Kanyongo’s benevolence.
