The Herald MADRID. — Barcelona dropped their first points of the season on Sunday as Sevilla made a statement of intent in the Spanish La Liga’s football title race by drawing 1-1 at Camp Nou. Luuk de Jong gave Sevilla an early lead and while Philippe Coutinho levelled two minutes later, the visitors were arguably the better side in a frantic contest. The draw brings an end to Ronald Koeman’s perfect start as Barca coach but he might not be too displeased with a point, even if his team also had chances to snatch a winner. “We were less energetic than in the first two games but that also depends on the opposition,” said Koeman. “They have defended well.” Real Madrid are three points ahead of Barcelona but having played a game more, after their 2-0 win over Levante earlier on Sunday sent them to the top of the table. Goals from Vinicius Junior and Karim Benzema sealed victory for the reigning champions, who have now won three games on the bounce. Neither Madrid nor Barca were expected to be busy on the last day of the transfer window yesterday, with both clubs finding themselves financially restricted by the coronavirus pandemic. But some players could be allowed to leave and it was noticeable that Koeman left Ousmane Dembele on the bench, even as his team searched for a winner. Koeman preferred to bring on the youthful duo of Francisco Trincao and Pedri. “Things can happen,” said Koeman afterwards when asked about Dembele. “Right now he’s a Barca player, let’s see. There is one day left, players can come in or go out.” Antoine Griezmann also offered very little down the right but the Frenchman will be given more time under Koeman. Luka Jovic was dropped to the bench by Zinedine Zidane and not brought on, but he is expected to stay after the departure of Borja Mayoral to Roma. —  AFP.
