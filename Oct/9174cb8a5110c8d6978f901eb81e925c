The Herald TRIPOLI. — Authorities in the Libyan capital Tripoli have arrested a man wanted by Interpol for human trafficking. Libya’s internationally-recognised government announced the detention of Abd al-Rahman al-Milad, known as Bija, on Wednesday. In 2018, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions against al-Milad and five other men over people smuggling in the North African country. Libya has emerged as a major migrant route to Europe in recent years. The country descended into lawlessness in the wake of the overthrow of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, with rival militias vying for power. Human rights groups say that migrants in Libya face widespread violence and abuse. France’s embassy in Libya welcomed Mr Milad’s arrest, which it described as “good news for combatting human trafficking”. In addition to the special bulletin issued by Interpol, al-Milad was also wanted in Libya. According to the UN, al-Milad headed the regional coast guard for the north-western coastal town of Zawiya, which “is consistently linked with violence against migrants and other human smugglers”. The UN’s panel of experts said in 2017 that al- Milad, along with other members of the coast guard, was “directly involved in the sinking of migrant boats using firearms”. — BBC.
