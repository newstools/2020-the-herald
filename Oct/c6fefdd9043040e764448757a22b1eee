The Herald Gold rose by more than 1 percent on Friday and was on course for a second straight weekly gain as the dollar weakened and renewed negotiations for US stimulus prompted investors to buy bullion as a hedge against inflation. Spot gold was up 1,2 percent to $1,915.36 per ounce by 1135 GMT, up 0.9 percent this week. US gold futures gained 1,4 percent to $1,921.30. “The gyrations on whether we are going to get a stimulus or not seems to be affecting gold prices; gold has rallied on huge stimulus from the US Federal Reserve and the government, and if that continues, it will support gold further,” said Robin Bhar, an independent analyst. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin resumed their talks over the coronavirus aid plan, after US President Donald Trump called off negotiations earlier this week. “Investors who have a portfolio in equities, fixed income, will also try to find ways of hedging the uncertainty on the economy and the stimulus,” Bhar added. Gold has gained 26 percent this year, boosted by massive stimulus globally to cushion the pandemic’s economic impact. The dollar fell against rivals, amid growing bets that Joe Biden would win the US presidential election and possibly offer more stimulus after that. The prospect of a Democrat win boosts the incentive to hold gold as a new relief package can be assembled if the ongoing stimulus talks fall apart, said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam.  —  Reuters.
