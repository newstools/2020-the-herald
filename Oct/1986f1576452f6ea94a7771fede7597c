The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter Investigations into charges that suspended Registrar-General Clement Masango misappropriated fuel coupons worth more than $100 000 from the Central Registry Department are almost complete and the State has promised to give him a trial date in four weeks. When Masango and his co-accused Benjamin Makiwa and Arthur Mathews came to court yesterday for a routine remand on criminal abuse of office charges, the State indicated that it was going through the docket. With only a few documents now needing certification, prosecutor Mr Taddy Kamuriwo was confident of being able to give the trial date on November 5 when they return to court. Magistrate Bianca Makwande then remanded them to November 5 for a trial date. Masango allegedly took possession of four pool vehicles of the Central Registry for personal errands at his home and farm between January last year and this year. Acting with his co-accused, he would allegedly request for fuel purporting that the vehicles were carrying out official finance and administration duties. He allegedly altered and overstated fuel quantities beyond those approved by his departmentâ€™s chief accountant, Mr Peter Bwanya. The scam allegedly prejudiced the department of over 1 400 litres worth more than $100 000.
