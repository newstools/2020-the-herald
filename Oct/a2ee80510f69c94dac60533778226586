The Herald CAIRO. — Former Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane got his Al Ahly career off to a flier as he guided Egyptian giants to a narrow 1-0 win over Mokawloon SC at the Cairo International Stadium on Sunday. The match got off to a nervy start for Mosimane’s charges who were forced to substitute goalkeeper Mohamed El-Shenawy after he suffered an injury in the 28th minute. However, a first half goal from the penalty spot by Amr El Solia was enough to secure maximum points for the Red Devils. Speaking to the club after the match coach Mosimane expressed his delight at the result giving some insights on his approach and wished his goalkeeper a speedy recovery. “I am very pleased after today’s win as we succeeded to defeat a tough opponent as they depend on the counter attacks. Each game has its own conditions and tactics, so we prepare for each one individually,” said Mosimane on the club’s official Twitter account. The only goal of the encounter on Sunday came a few minutes before the half-time break and it was enough to hand Mosimane a winning start in Egypt. Mosimane, who resigned as Mamelodi Sundowns head coach on Wednesday, was hoping to start his tenure at the Red Devils with a victory after replacing Rene Weiler on Thursday. The accomplished tactician recalled club captain Mohamed El Shenawy to the starting line-up after he was rested by Weiler in the midweek clash against Tersana. Weiler led Al Ahly to a 2-1 win over Tersana on Wednesday in what proved to be the Swiss coach’s last match in charge of the Cairo giants and he has since been replaced by Mosimane. Al Ahly were determined to record thAl Ahly’s next match is against ENPPI SC in a domestic league match tomorrow and Mosimane’s side has three games left in the competition. — goal.com.
