The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter GEORGE Magariro, who spent more than two decades in the trenches of domestic football, is now slowly shifting his focus to coaching. He had planned to have his farewell season with ZIFA Eastern Region Division One side Masvingo United this year. However, he hasn’t been able to kick a ball because of the Covid-19 restrictions which have halted the game. The former Lancashire Steel, Dynamos, CAPS United, ZPC Kariba and How Mine defender said he was now focusing on coaching and wants to add more badges once authorities give the green-light for football activities to resume. Magariro is now part of the Masvingo United technical set-up where he is a player-assistant coach. “I believe football will return one day so that I can see off my long career in style. I hope to help Yuna Yuna regain their Premiership status. “Masvingo United are a big institution and I hope, with the effort we are putting in, we will have something to smile about in the near future. “I am still playing but my focus is now more on coaching. “At the moment, we are trying to groom players from Masvingo so that they become top players and the good thing is most of the youngsters we are working with saw us when we were playing and this motivates them.” He said they could benefit immensely if the local community rally behind them. “I am grateful to my fellow coach, Luka Njanji, who is very supportive and there is a local lawyer and businessman, Philip Shumba, who is so passionate about soccer,’’ he said.
