WITH karate still to resume competition, the newly-formed Zimbabwe National Karate Federation are channelling their efforts towards improving their structures. And, efforts are underway to bring in a World Karate Federation referee to conduct a course for their officials, before the end of year. The course is set for November and ZNKF president, Joe Rugwete, said they were in the process of engaging their members to see who will be able to attend. “We are looking at how many of our members are able to attend, we first have to have confirmation, if our members can attend the course, and then come up with dates. “The courses are certified before international competitions but we are taking advantage of lack of physical activities so that when we resume regional, and international competitions, they would have been trained,” said Rugwete. The national karate federation, which is now responsible for semi-contact karate, and is registered with the Sports Commission, have since applied for membership to the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee. They are now waiting for the National Olympic Committee’s response. “They confirmed they received our application,” said Rugwete. The ZNKF were formed to ensure that the semi-contact karate members comply with the statutes of the World Karate Federation, which bar their members from having sporting relationships, with other karate associations, not recognised by WKF. The ZNKF president said although not much has changed, since their breakaway from the Zimbabwe Karate Union now responsible for full contact karate, they were now working on long-term athletes’ development for the future. “Nothing has really changed, except that we are ensuring that we comply with our world mother body, the World Karate Federation. “The way we have been planning our programme remains the same. “We are doing long-term athlete development programmes because we understand that to prepare for the Olympics it takes time.
