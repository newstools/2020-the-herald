The Herald Eddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter TARISAI MUSAKANDA became the first player to score a century in the new National Premier League cricket competition. He led MidWest Rhinos to an emphatic 148-run win over Gladiators at Harare Sports Club yesterday. The 25-year-old was duly named man-of-the-match, following his impressive 142, as MidWest Rhinos recovered from the defeat at the hands of Takashinga on the opening day. Musakanda, who returned from a brief stint in Australia earlier this year, faced 117 deliveries. The right-handed batsman is looking to reclaim his place in the Zimbabwe national team, two years after he last represented the side. Musakanda has 15 ODIs and six T20Is under the belt. His fluent knock yesterday helped Rhinos amass a commanding 306-8 in their allotted 45 overs. A half century from Takudzwa Kaitano (63), and a handy 42 from former Zimbabwe youth international Nyasha Mayavo, was all the Midlands side needed to take control of the game. Gladiators’ Masimba Maruvatsanga finished with bowling figures of 4/59. There was also a half century from Wesley Madhevere but the youthful outfit still fell short, recording their second defeat in as many games. Takashinga’s Blessing Muzarabani announced his return to the domestic scene with a five-wicket haul against Easterns at Takashinga Sports Club. His heroics with the ball, however, could not count for anything as they still lost to the visitors by five runs. Muzarabani, who landed in the country on Sunday evening from England where his Kolpak contract with county side Northamptonshire is set to be terminated, finished with impressive figures of 5/28. Easterns were sent to bat first, under the cloudy conditions, and were dismissed for 168 in 43.3 overs. National team all-rounder, Donald Tiripano, top scored for them with 40 runs. The target looked achievable but Takashinga stumbled, with Zimbabwe fast bowler Tendai Chatara, claiming his own five-for. Chatara’s 5/27 bettered what Muzarabanui had achieved earlier in the morning. Roy Kaia showed some resistance, with his 61, but Easterns still managed to defend their total. Two other matches were affected by the rains which pounded the country yesterday. There was no result at Kwekwe Sports Club after the clash between Harare Kings and Amakhosi was abandoned because of the rains and a wet outfield. The match had been reduced to 18 overs following a late toss. Harare Kings captain, Sikandar Raza, had won the toss and chose to bowl first. However, it was agreed that it was unsafe to continue with the game under the wet conditions. Both teams had won their opening matches. The match between Queens and Great Zimbabwe Patriots at Queens Sports Club was also affected by the rains. But, the hosts still managed to secure a 44-run victory under the conditions. The contest was reduced to 24 overs following a delayed start and Luke Jongwe (31) and skipper Chamu Chibhabha (29) gave them a fighting chance with a competitive 129/9. The Patriots were skittled all out for just 80 runs. Queens’ Sean Williams took 4/22 while the man-of-the-match award went to Tanatswa Bechani for his 2/3.
