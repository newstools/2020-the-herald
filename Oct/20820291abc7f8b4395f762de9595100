The Herald Crime Reporter THREE suspected armed robbers who were armed with a pistol and machetes raided an apostolic shrine and kidnapped one of the congregants before they later attacked nine other people at a cemetery in Beitbridge last week. The robbers got away with cellphones valued at US$6 020, R11 030 in cash and an assortment of goods. Police are also investigating a case in which an earth moving machine that was stolen at gunpoint in South Africa, was recovered in Beitbridge while being loaded on to a cargo truck. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed all the incidents. “Police in Beitbridge are investigating two cases of armed robberies which occurred on October 7, 2020. Three unknown men stormed an apostolic church shrine at the new stands in Beitbridge, armed with an unidentified pistol and machetes before kidnapping one of the complainants.” Investigations on the cases are still in progress and no arrests have since been made so far. “The victim was shoved into the boot of his Honda Fit and eventually robbed off his valuables at Makakabule Village,” he said. Asst Comm Nyathi said in the same village the three later pounced on nine others at a grave site and robbed them off their valuables. “All the victims were tied with pieces of cloth before the assailants went away with a Silver Honda Fit registration number AFH 6575, various cellphones valued at US$6 020 and R11 030,” he said. The earth moving machine was found being loaded into a cargo carrier by police following a tip off. Asst Comm Nyathi said, “The machine was stolen by means of robbery on September 19, 2020 and a cargo carrier had been hired to carry it to Malawi. Investigations are in progress.”
