The Herald The US dollar and South African rand pair rose by more than 0,25 percent today as traders digested news that Donald Trump had contracted coronavirus. The pair is trading at 16,6430, which is higher than yesterday’s low of 16,54. In a statement earlier today, Donald Trump revealed that he had infected the Covid-19. Melania Trump, his wife, and Hope Hicks, a senior aide, have also tested positive. As a result, experts believe that other senior administration officials have also contracted the illness. This announcement has sent shivers around the world, with most people worried about what will happen next. As a result, the US dollar, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and gold have all risen while US and European equities have declined. That is because analysts consider the former assets to be safe havens. Indeed, the dollar has risen across other developed world and emerging market currencies, including the South African rand. Meanwhile, the dollar and South African rand pair is also waiting for the non-farm payrolls numbers that will come out later today. — news24.com.
