The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Iconic Metro FM presenter Wilson B Nkosi says the honour he received from fellow presenters and management at the weekend for long service at the station meant that he has fulfilled his childhood dream of becoming a DJ. The management and radio presenters threw a surprise celebration for Nkosi on Sunday for his solid 34 years radio broadcasting milestone at the popular radio station. The surprise honour was live on Sunday during Nkosi’s famous show Sounds and Stuff Like That where he was presented with an award. The show had to be taken over by Mo Flava while the management, colleagues and his family celebrated him. Speaking to Sowetan on Monday, Nkosi, said the act of kindness and appreciation left him trembling because it was overwhelming. He explained that as much as he was honoured, he can never brag that he deserved it. The seasoned broadcaster said receiving such an honour meant that he has lived his childhood dream of becoming a radio presenter. “To be honest, I was not aware about the celebration. I just saw managers, including Melanie Bala, coming into the studio with cameras and taking pictures. I got to understand how coups work because I did not see it coming. When Mo Flava took over the show he kept saying I must relax but I told him that I have not relaxed for a second since they took over the show,” Nkosi said. The station posted a message: “Thank you to Wilson B Nkosi for his contribution.” — Sowetan.
