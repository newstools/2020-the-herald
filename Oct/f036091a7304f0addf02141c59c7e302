The Herald ISLAMABAD. — Vice-captain Shadab Khan has highlighted the importance of Pakistan’s upcoming limited-overs series against Zimbabwe, bearing in mind the tour of New Zealand in December. The first of the three ODIs against Zimbabwe is set to be played on Friday at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, Rawalpindi. The three-match ODI series is part of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League and acts as qualification round for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2023. The second match will be played on November 1 with the third and final match taking place on November 3. “We won’t be taking Zimbabwe lightly at all. We are fully focused on the job at hand and during the season we are very keen on improving both our game and fitness,” Shadab told pcb.com.pk. “Many players discuss fitness and how to improve in that area which is a positive sign indeed. “For us each and every point in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League matters. “A convincing victory against Zimbabwe will hold us in good stead when we depart for the tour of New Zealand,” he added. Shadab also believes that the recently concluded National T20 Cup was helpful in preparing adequately for the international assignments. “We had an excellent build-up to the Zimbabwe series with the National T20 Cup. The tournament was highly competitive. “Such tournaments will help narrow the gap between domestic and international levels. “The revamped domestic system surely provides that opportunity to the players,” he said. — pcb.com.pk.
