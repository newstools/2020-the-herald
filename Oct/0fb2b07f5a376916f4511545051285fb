The Herald ESTHER Mbofana made history when she took the first hat-trick of the Women’s Fifty50 Challenge cricket to propel Eagles Women to a massive 142-run victory over Tuskers Women at Kwekwe Sports Club at the weekend. Mbofana was imperious in returning figures of eight wickets for 21 runs as Tuskers were skittled out for 55 runs in 22.5 overs. The innings saw only Regai Matongo getting to double figures with an unbeaten 10 runs. Mbofana’s crowning moment came as she dismissed Tasmeen Granger, Nomvelo Sibanda, both bowled, and Saidi Thuba, trapped leg before in the 11th over. At that point, Tuskers were reduced to 21-9 and getting to 55 was a combination of a lot of extras and some resilience from the final partnership. Precious Marange finally broke it when Natasha Mtomba was given out leg before on two. Earlier, Marange top-scored with 45 runs, as Eagles were bowled out for 197 in 48.5 overs. In the other Fifty50 Challenge match played at Harare Sports Club, Mountaineers Women were impressive in their chase as they claimed a six-wicket victory over Rhinos Women. Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano (51) and Pellagia Mujaji (59) both registered half-centuries. Their partnership amassed 88 runs before Mugeri-Tiripano was caught by Mary-Anne Musonda off the bowling of Nomatter Mutasa. Her innings included six fours. Loryn Phiri picked up from there, finding the boundary regularly for an impressive, controlled, unbeaten 43. While Mujaji would fall to Musonda leg before, enough had been done for the win — Mujaji and Phiri had combined for 77. The remaining 30 runs were picked off with Nyasha Gwanzura finishing unbeaten on 16. Mountaineers reached 210 for nine in 40.3 overs. Earlier, Musonda claimed the first half-century of the competition with an impressive 87. Her partnership of 114 with captain Josephine Nkomo was the highlight of the Rhinos innings. When Musonda finally departed — Audrey Mazvishaya trapping her leg before — she had found the boundary 15 times. Nomatter Mutasa joined Nkomo for a partnership of 31. The former would go for 22, bowled by Greatness Mutasa before Nkomo departed shortly after for 42, the first of Francesca Chipare’s five victims. Chipare tore through the middle and lower Rhinos batting order, returning figures of five for 21. Rumbidzai Nire and Mazvishaya also bagged wickets, two apiece, as Rhinos were all out for 209 in 46.3 overs. The domestic women’s cricket competitions kicked off with the T20 Cup on Friday.
