The Herald MARY-ANNE Musonda and Josephine Nkomo both scored unbeaten half-centuries to inspire Rhinos Women to a 14-run victory over Mountaineers Women in the first match of the inaugural Women’s T20 Cup at Harare Sports Club yesterday. Nkomo won the toss and elected to bat first and it looked like a bad idea when Kelly Ndiraya was removed for a duck, having faced only five balls, bowled by Rumbidzai Nire. Ashley Ndiraya did not stick around for much longer, out for three, trapped leg before by Nyasha Gwanzura, and on 12 for two, they looked in a spot of bother. Enter Nkomo, to join national team captain Musonda, and the two showed why their stock in the game is high. When Nkomo joined in, Musonda was on 12. The two batted comfortably, against a youthful Mountaineers, picking boundaries on a regular basis. Musonda made history when she became the first player to hit a half-century in the Women’s T20 Cup, her feat coming off 49 balls. Nkomo soon followed and their 119-run partnership helped them to a healthy 140 for two from their 20 overs. Musonda was unbeaten on 64 while Nkomo finished on 56, also not out. With Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano opening for Mountaineers, the Eastern Highlands side would have felt their chances were high.
