The Herald LONDON. — Dillian Whyte was not caught by a “lucky punch” from Alexander Povetkin, who had hit Zimbabwe-born British heavyweight boxer Derek Chisora with the same brutal uppercut in sparring, says David Haye. The British heavyweight rivals are preparing for career-changing fights as Chisora collides with Oleksandr Usyk on October 31, while Whyte battles Povetkin in a rematch on November 21. Chisora has sparred with Povetkin in the past and was not surprised that he delivered a fight-ending uppercut on Whyte, says manager Haye, who insists the Brixton man did not just pay the price for a momentary lapse. Asked about Povetkin-Whyte 2, Haye told Sky Sports: “It’s a very dangerous fight and it’s a fight that I think Dillian doesn’t want to accept it was nothing other than a lucky punch. “He thought, “I was winning the fight’, which he was, ‘I had him knocked down twice in the fourth round and I was winning the fifth round until I got hit by one shot and that was it’. Anything can happen in boxing, it happens in the heavyweight division. “I don’t think that’s the mindset you need. You can’t say, “You won because it was an anomaly.” That left uppercut that he threw knocked out Carlos Takam, in a very even fight, in a very good toe-to-toe fight. “It’s a shot that he throws regularly. Derek was telling me when he sparred with him, he was getting hit with that shot, so it’s one of his shots, and to get hit with someone’s best shot isn’t very lucky is it. —Sky Sports.
