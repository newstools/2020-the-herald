AT least two Bulawayo City players have tested positive for Covid-19 following tests done by the Premiership club in preparation for resumption of training. The duo become the first footballers in the domestic league to test positive to Covid-19. Fifteen City players, technical team members and the club’s secretariat underwent Covid-19 PCR testing on Thursday afternoon, courtesy of the local authority’s health department. Sources said a goalkeeper and a player registered in the Under-20 development slots tested positive. “Two players tested positive and they are now in isolation. They’re asymptomatic. Now the club is waiting for guidance from the health department before releasing a statement,” said a source. City had taken a proactive approach to have their players tested in anticipation of returning to training. On Friday, the Sports and Recreation Commission granted football permission to resume training, on condition that they meet certain Covid-19 health regulations. Part of the regulations include having players, technical teams and support staff tested before resuming training. Club general-manager Sikhumbuzo Ndebele was excited that the club conducted tests. “The test exercise is internally motivated. The players being out and about for a greater breath of the year, in health regulatory compliance, safety is at the centre of what we do,” said Ndebele after Thursday’s tests.
