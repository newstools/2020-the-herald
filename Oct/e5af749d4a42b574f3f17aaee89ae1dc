The Herald WINDHOEK. – The Meat Board of Namibia (MBN) said on yesterday that it is scouting for newer markets for Namibian beef to expand opportunities for farmers. According to the MBN, it has launched several studies and investigations to identify evolving markets to add to its traditional markets, namely South Africa, China, the United States, Norway and the European Union. The meat board said it has conducted research regarding several Middle Eastern markets which has shown promising results. “Current markets are foot-and-mouth disease sensitive and therefore Middle-Eastern markets can offer alternatives,” the board said in a statement. “We need to be cognisant of the current limited production of cattle and beef as a consequence of the 2019 drought, and that further research on alternative markets will not necessarily lead to market utilisation,” said the statement. The MBN also noted that total cattle marketing decreased by 31 percent in the January-August period, in spite of producer prices showing a 2 percent increase for slaughter cattle and a 39 percent increase for weaner calves. Exports of weaner calves that represent 63 percent of the total cattle market share decreased by 49 percent during the reported period, it added. – xinhuanet.com
