The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter Former Zanu PF youths commissar Godfrey Tsenengamu has been denied bail. Harare magistrate Mr Ngoni Nduna said it was in the best interest to safeguard his safety after he sought refuge at the police claiming there were people who were stalking him. Mr Nduna also said it was not correct that Tsenengamu surrendered himself to the police after having been on the run for nearly three months.
