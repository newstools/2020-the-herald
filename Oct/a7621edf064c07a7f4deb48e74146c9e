The Herald TEXAS. — A Texas police officer stands charged with murder in the shooting of a 31-year-old Black man after a preliminary investigation determined his actions were unreasonable, authorities said. Wolfe City officer Shaun Lucas responded to a call about a possible fight after 8 pm on Saturday, just north of the city centre, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. Wolfe City is about 70km northeast of Dallas. “Officer Lucas made contact with a man, later identified as 31-year-old Jonathan Price, who was reportedly involved in the disturbance. Officer Lucas attempted to detain Price, who resisted in a non-threatening posture and began walking away,” a DPS statement said. Lucas used his Taser and then fired his weapon, hitting Price, the statement said. Price died at a hospital, according to the statement. “The preliminary investigation indicates that the actions of Officer Lucas were not (objectively) reasonable,” it said. – CNN
