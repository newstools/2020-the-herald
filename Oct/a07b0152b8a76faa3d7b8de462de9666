The Herald A NEW kid on the block will be introduced this afternoon at Borrowdale Park racecourse. The ZinFun syndicate will introduce their horse, Tricky Business, for the 1600m Maiden Plate. Borrowdale Park has had its fair share of successful racing syndicates and this could go a long way towards attracting new owners to the sport. The feature race today has attracted some top performers. Peggson’s nine wins include the 1600m Ipi Tombe Stakes (L) in 2019, the 2019 Castle Tankard (Gr1) run over 2000m, and the 2000m Breeders Champions Cup (L) in 2020. It will be interesting as there is Yarraman, who narrowly beat Peggson in February over the same distance, at level weights. In the Zimbabwe Challenge, Peggson will give, at least 4kg, to the rest of the field, including Yarraman, and that is a tough task. Although Gokhan Terzi’s charge enjoys a significant turnaround, in weights with his rival now, he must deal with his stable companion, Fareeq. In the Pro Bar Breeders Sprint, on August 28, Fareeq, at level weights, finished a length clear of Yarraman over 1 450m.  Fareeq has won four races from 1 260m to 1 800m, so comes reckoning here. Zimbabwe Derby winner, Three to Tango, is a versatile sort, having won from 1 200m to 2 400m. In the past, Peggson and Yarraman have usually had the upper hand, but the son of Grey’s Inn (USA) has more pull in the weights this time. That said, Apprentice Satombo has the ride on Three To Tango and may not be able to make full use of his 4kg allowance. When Holy Land won the 1 600m Independence Trophy in June, Fareeq and Three To Tango, both receiving 1kg, finished inches in front of Peggson. On paper they should walk this. Three To Tango’s stable companion, What A Dandy, faces stiffer opposition here, but won his last start over 1 600m, beating Bugatti Blue. In addition to Peggson, Bridget Stidolph will saddle Wantage and Butchie Boy — both set to carry 54kg — but in this field they have work to do. The first race today is due off at 12.25pm and the Zimbabwe Challenge at 15.55pm. — Zim Racing/Sports Reporter.
