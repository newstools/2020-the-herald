AFTER dominating Borrowdale Park races, Lily Blue has moved to South Africa where she took part in her first race on Sunday and managed a place. Formerly trained by Bridget Stidolph, at Borrowdale Park, Lily Blue, the daughter of Black Minnaloushe (USA), is now in Paul Matchett’s yard in Gauteng. In her first attempt, in her new environment, Lily Blue managed a fourth place finish at Turffontein and was only 1.25 lengths off the winner. Lily Blue, raced in the 1600m MR 95 Handicap (F&M) at Turffontein, which gave Zimbabwe racing fans something to smile about. Before leaving for South Africa, Lily Blue had become Borrowdale Park’s darling, having won seven successive victories. Bred by Geoff Armitage, Lily Blue won two legs of the Triple Crown — the Zimbabwe Guineas and the Zimbabwe Derby — where she took on the boys. She made history by joining Centre Stage, Prescott and Candy Cane, three brave fillies who have won the Zimbabwe Oaks. Prescott and Candy Cane, as well as Lily Blue, were trained by Bridget Stidolph. The runner was usually partnered by Morgan Nyamagwete. Meanwhile, racing is expected to resume this weekend after several weeks of course maintenance. Borrowdale Park was last used on August 28 and, this Saturday, seven races have been lined up.
