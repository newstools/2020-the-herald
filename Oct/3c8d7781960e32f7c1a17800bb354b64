The Herald Junior Chamber International is an organisation that provides development opportunities for young people in order for them to create positive change in their communities. It is this desire that has seen JCI working in the Siachilaba area of Binga District creating a better environment for school children in the area. The involvement has seen the organisation mobilising funds and resources for constructing classroom blocks. The intention is to cut down on the long distances that school children travel in order to get to school. Construction started with resources from individual donors, while the community assisted with moulding of bricks. The overall objective is to establish a firm foundation for the provision of quality education and promotion of better learning environment and opportunities. This will be achieved with the establishment of improved educational infrastructure. The work being undertaken seeks to motivate pupils to attend schools, while the better infrastructure is motivation for teachers working in resource poor rural communities, where often they make do without running water and electricity. At the centre of the intervention is establishment of a community driven approach and creation of a long-term ownership of the educational infrastructure by the local community. Reflecting on the work the organisation is conducting in Binga, current JCI president, Patience Charehwa, says the early part of the year (2020) presented a fair share of the challenges they faced. “These range from economic challenges, the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic… These challenges have had some disruptive impact on our plans and operations.” The target is to build classroom blocks, have them furnished before handing them over to the community.
