A 39-year-old Harare man lost over US$3 200 and a pistol to unknown thieves who broke into his car which he had parked at a shop in the Graniteside area of Harare. The theft comes at a time police are continuously urging the public to desist from leaving cash and valuables in their vehicles. Over the past few months, some people have lost cash and valuables, especially in Bulawayo, to thieves who broke into their parked vehicles. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident yesterday and warned the public against leaving cash and firearms in their vehicles. “On October 16, 2020 a man aged 38 parked his vehicle in Graniteside, Harare, and went into a shop,” he said. “On coming back, he discovered that the vehicle’s window had been smashed and cash amounting to US$3 234 and a firearm had been stolen. The firearm was later recovered dumped near the Prospect area (in Waterfalls, Harare).” No arrests have been made and police are still looking for the suspects. Thefts and robberies of foreign currency have become frequent countrywide, especially in Bulawayo, where a man lost US$50 000 cash after thieves broke into his car while he was parked in the city centre, and another who lost US$50 000 along Samuel Parirenyatwa Street between 14th and 15th Avenues when he parked his Toyota Prado.
