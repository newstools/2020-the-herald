BODYBUILDER, Gideon Teguru, is doubtful for the last National Federation of Zimbabwe Bodybuilding and Fitness contest, the Harare Classic, in two months’ time. The hulk, who began his bodybuilding career from a humble background at a backyard gym in Epworth, has been battling for sponsorship. Harare Classic is scheduled for December 13 at the Zimbabwe College of Music. Teguru, who has been training throughout the lockdown period, feels he might not be in good shape if he doesn’t get the support he requires. “Like any other athlete, I am happy that we are going to have a contest before year end but I do not think I will make the podium. ‘’There are several challenges, which I can talk about, in terms of what is needed for preparing for such a big stage. “I never stopped training and, during the lockdown, we were doing it at home. ‘‘Now, that the gyms are open to the public, I am happy we are using machines which can see us back to our best. ‘‘As I speak, I have no sponsorship so it becomes a challenge for me.’’ The bodybuilder is part of a cast of hulks who have been competing at the highest level in the past years. A 2018 Marume Classic winner, he was once bankrolled by Herentals Group of Colleges. He was recently sponsored by a local businessman, who is based in the United Kingdom. ‘‘My sponsor is currently out of the country so it’s difficult for me to say I am going to contest but I would have loved to be part of the competition. ‘’The preparations need a lot and I do not think I can go it alone.’’ said Teguru. This year’s Harare Classic will be interesting as it is coming in a year where most contests were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
