The Herald Sports Reporter PREMIERSHIP clubs will each receive US$5 500 from ZIFA as part of Covid-19 relief package from funds received from FIFA and CAF. It’s the same amount they were allocated when the ZIFA board first met to allocate funds to their affiliates. There had been fears the PSL clubs would get less than what they were originally scheduled to receive amid reports the regions and the provinces were also asking for a bigger share. However, the ZIFA leaders, who met on Monday, decided to retain the same amounts which they had allocated to the country’s top-flight clubs. The money, though, will be paid in local currency at a rate of US$1 to $82.56. This means the clubs will be paid $454 080 each. This is part of the US$1.3 million bailout package from FIFA and CAF which was released last week. Part of that money, US$500 000, is specifically meant for women’s football. The association will receive a further US$500 000 from FIFA, for men’s football, in January next year. “The ZIFA executive committee met on the 17th of August 2020 and deliberated on the following: ZIFA executive committee will continue engaging affiliates and stakeholders for the development and growth of football in the country Following consultations with affiliates, covid-19 relief allocations have been revised and will be distributed as per attached schedule.

The Association will continue to consult stakeholders and affiliates on the safe return to football activities.
