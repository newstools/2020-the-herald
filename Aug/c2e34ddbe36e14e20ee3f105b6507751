The Herald Crime Reporter Zimbabwe and Botswana police are still investigating the death of a Zimbabwean man, who was found unconscious at Mapakata cattle post in the neighbouring country and was rushed to hospital, where he died. The man has been identified as Thapelo Ndlovu (36), believed to be from Kezi District, but no one can locate his family. The body is still in a Botswana hospital mortuary. There are fears that the man could have been attacked by villagers in the area where he was found. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said Ndlovu was found unconscious at Mapakata cattle post in Botswana on July 8, 2020 and died on July 18, 2020. Police are appealing to members of the public who may be related to Ndlovu to report at their nearest police station or contact Matabeleland South provincial spokesperson Chief Inspector Ndebele on 02842 -22810 or 0715 431 235 or 0773 594 899. This is not the first time that Zimbabweans have been found dead or murdered in the neighbouring country. In 2017, two men, aged 19 and 20, were arrested in Botswana on suspicion of killing a 30-year-old Zimbabwean man whose corpse was found buried near in Mahalapye. The suspects were allegedly engaged by the deceased as helpers on his piece-job, where they were fitting tiles. According to police investigations, the piece-job was allegedly concluded on November 24, the day the deceased allegedly met his fate. Superintendent Isaac Mamadi of Mahalapye Police said the two suspects allegedly took the car belonging to the deceased and used it on their trips to the cattle post around Mahalapye. He said the car led the police to the arrest of the duo after the matter was reported by a woman who stayed with the deceased, who had been worried by his mysterious disappearance.
