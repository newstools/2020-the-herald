WARRIORS defender Teenage Hadebe has been named in the Turkish Super League Team of the Season. Hadebe was one of the outstanding performers for his side Yeni Malatyaspor during the just ended 2019/2020 campaign. He was named along with veteran former Liverpool star Martin Skertl, who starred for champions Istanbul Basaksehir, as the best two centrebacks.  Congolese Fabrice N’Sakala and Brazilian Junior Caicara are the other defenders on the list. Hadebe is the only player from Malatyaspor in the select following a debut that saw him being named in the team of the week several times. Despite his performances, his team finished in the bottom three. They could have been relegated but they got a reprieve from the Turkish Football Federation, who ruled that no club will be relegated because of the challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
