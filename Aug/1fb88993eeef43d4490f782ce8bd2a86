The Herald LOS ANGELES. — Superstar LeBron James says basketball will not miss Donald Trump after the US president said he turns off games featuring social justice protests. Trump has accused players of “disrespect” by taking a knee during the national anthem. “I really don’t think the basketball community are sad about losing his viewership,” said the Los Angeles Lakers superstar. “I can speak for all of us who love the game and we could (not) care less.” Four-time NBA most valuable player James, who is fronting a campaign in the run-up to November’s presidential election to protect African-American voting rights, said that the sport’s fans appreciated the players’ stand on social and political issues. “Our game is in a beautiful position and we’ve got fans all over the world,” James added. “Our fans love and respect what we try to bring to the game, what’s right and what’s wrong.” It is not the first time that James has criticised President Trump. James called Trump a “bum” and referred to him as a “so-called president” in 2017. Trump in turn has suggested he prefers Chicago Bulls great Michael Jordan as a player.  The vast majority of NBA players and staff have chosen to kneel during the playing of the pre-game national anthem in protest at racial injustice. — BBC Sport.
