The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Manchester City owner, Sheikh Mansour, is set to invest in Africa to acquire the 10th club under the City Football Group umbrella. In May this year, the CFG ‘expanded their global presence’ with the acquisition of a ninth club in the form of Belgian second-division outfit Lommel SK. With teams in North America, South America, Australia and various parts of Asia, the group led by the Emrati billionaire have new reportedly set the sight on Egyptian Premier League side Pyramids. According to Yallakora, talks have opened with the ambitious side who have shaken up North African football since being formed after the takeover of Al Assiouty Sport in 2018. The highest-spending club on the continent pulled off a major coup this week already over giants Al Ahly when they beat them to the signature of Egypt winger Ramadan Sobhi from Huddersfield. Sobhi, who was touted as the next Mohamed Aboutrika after graduating from Ahly’s academy agreed a three-year contract worth R666k-a-week. And now it seems as their spending power may reach another level if the prospective takeover is completed. Pyramids are currently second in the Egyptian top-flight behind the Red Devils after 19 games and will face Guinea Ligue 1 Pro side Horoya FC in the semi-final of the CAF Confederation Cup in September. — KickOff.com.
