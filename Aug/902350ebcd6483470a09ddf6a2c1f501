The Herald SILVERSTONE. — Six-time Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton said “survival instinct” clicked in after a last-lap puncture almost cost the Mercedes driver a record seventh British Grand Prix on Sunday. Hamilton had been cruising to a solid home victory from pole position at Silverstone, with Finnish teammate Valtteri Bottas second, until the fates packed a race-worth of drama into the last two laps. Bottas’s tyre went first, dropping the Finn to 11th at the finish, and then it was Hamilton’s turn with the Briton suddenly finding himself driving on three tyres with Red Bull’s Max Verstappen catching up fast. Only the fact that the Dutch driver had stopped for fresh tyres to claim the fastest lap, leaving him 31 seconds to make up, saved the day. Hamilton said his heart had also nearly stopped, but instinct clicked in to secure his third win in a row and 87th of his career — four short of Michael Schumacher’s all-time record. “As the minutes go by I feel worse and worse when I realise what just happened,” he told reporters. — AFP.
