The Herald KINGSTON. — The world’s fastest man Usain Bolt is in quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19 just days after a party for his 34th birthday. England footballer Raheem Sterling, who attended the party,has tested negative. Jamaica’s health ministry said late on Monday that Bolt, the world 100m and 200m record holder, had tested positive for the virus. He had earlier posted a video on social media saying he was waiting to hear back on his results — before urging anyone who had come into contact with him recently to enter quarantine. Jamaica’s Minister of Health and Wellness, Christopher Tufton, reportedly confirmed Bolt had been notified of the positive test and contact tracing was underway. “I’m just waking up, and like everybody else I checked social media which is saying I am confirmed to have Covid-19,” said Bolt, who had a surprise birthday party thrown in his honour on Friday. “I did a test on Saturday to leave because I work. I am trying to be responsible so I am going to stay in and stay here for my friends.” “I’m having no symptoms so I am going to quarantine myself and wait on the confirmation, to see what is the protocol and how I should go about quarantining myself,” Bolt added. “Until then, I am saying anyone who has had contact with me should quarantine by themselves just to be safe, and just to take it easy.” Videos on social media from the party showed Bolt dancing with dozens of other people, most of whom were not wearing masks or social distancing. Jamaica has had a confirmed total of 1 413 Covid-19 cases and 16 deaths on the island of around three million people.  But there are fears that cases could be on the rise, especially in the capital Kingston, with 410 new cases in the last 14 days. Bolt, who won eight Olympic titles before retiring in 2017, also holds the world record in the 100m and 200m events having clocked 9.58 seconds and 19.19 seconds respectively at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin. — BBC Sport.
