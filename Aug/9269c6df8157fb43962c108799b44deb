The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United defender Harry Maguire said he feared for his life when Greek police arrested him last week as he thought he was being kidnapped. The England international told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that plain-clothed police officers, who did not identify themselves, pulled over his group’s minibus in Mykonos, threw him off the bus, hit him on his legs and told him his career was over. The 27-year-old said he tried to run away — with one handcuff on — because he had no idea who the men were. On Tuesday, Maguire was given a suspended sentence of 21 months and 10 days in prison after his trial on the Greek island of Syros. He was found guilty of repeated bodily harm, attempted bribery, violence against public employees and insult after arrest on Mykonos. On Wednesday, his legal team lodged an appeal against the verdict. In accordance with Greek law, the appeal nullifies Maguire’s conviction and there will be a full retrial in a more senior court. An emotional Maguire, who broke down during the interview, said hearing the guilty verdict was “horrible” and that he “couldn’t quite believe it”. The centre-back, who denies throwing any punches or trying to bribe the police, added: “I don’t feel I owe an apology to anybody. — BBC Sport.
