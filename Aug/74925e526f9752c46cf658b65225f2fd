THE Hatfield Airways chip-and-putt golf course is in a sorry state and this has forced authorities to close it. The course is being neglected by the Harare City Council. Located along Airport Road, the course was originally meant for travellers who will be waiting for their flights, and could not spend time at the normal nearby Falcon Golf Club course. It has nine holes. “It’s not normal and we are getting a raw deal from the city council as there is no maintenance and the course has since closed,’’ a worker told The Herald. “We are now focusing on growing vegetables. “This used to be a very good course, which had over 100 members, but it has since been turned into a white elephant. “There used to be some golf enthusiasts who preferred to play on this chip and putt course. “There are no tee boxes and putting greens to talk about, as you can see, there used to be a lot of activity here, with people enjoying the shot course. “But, due to lack of maintenance, there is nothing to talk about. I think the responsible authorities, the Council, are to blame as the swimming pool is no longer functional as well.’’ The swimming pool used to cater for Hatfield residents but, as of now, it has no water and has been closed.’’
