The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter TRIATHLON Zimbabwe are looking at spreading the sport to different parts of the country. The sport has mainly been dominant in Harare but the national association have revealed efforts are underway to take the sport to different provinces. They are also targeting schools. Some of the schools have the required facilities, which is a key component for developmental programmes, and makes it easy to organise and implement programmes. Triathlon Zimbabwe president, Dave Ellis, who took over from Demos Koutoungos in June, said they want sport spreading to different provinces. “It’s pretty much work in progress, we are hoping to take the sport across the country,’’ said Ellis. “Obviously, we have been hoping to take it more to the schools and to the different provinces, we are starting to work on that. “Bulawayo is an area we would like to develop into, and develop the sport there, more into the grassroots and into the schools, bring it up. “And, also, just make it fun and safe for families.” They are also targeting to increase corporate participation and have roped in Eve Mudzingwa to their marketing and sponsorship team. “We are trying to impact the corporate field so that we get corporate challenges, which will increase the participation, and bring the sport to a wider variety of people,’’ said Ellis. “We have Eve Mudzingwa, she has joined our team and she is going to be focusing on that challenge to bring in the corporates.’’ A number of promising young athletes have been on the rise, including Matthew Denslow, Andie Kuipers, Luke Hacker, Mikayla Colgraveand Luke Steffens. The national association have come up with a provisional calendar for the new season they are hoping could get underway next month depending on clearance from authorities. They are looking at preparing their athletes for the season through some training events with the first one, a duathlon, expected this weekend at Donnybrook.
