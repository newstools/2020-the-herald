The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter FALCON Golf Club chairman, Nicholas Munyonga, believes they are doing well in managing the club, and the course during these difficult times. Munyonga was appointed chairman of the Hatfield-based recreational facility before the national lockdown. “I am grateful to be given such a leading role,’’ he said. “The chairmanship came through the recommendation of some trustees so I need to give them back something special for the confidence they showed in me. “I effectively become the chairman before the lockdown and I think we are managing despite the challenges. “The club had challenges, like everyone else, as we suffered from operational costs when there was a complete lockdown. “The course needed maintenance and workers also looked up to us to provide them with their salaries.’’ A former Warriors team doctor, Munyonga’s passion for golf dates back to 2014. “I am grateful to the trustees, namely Alex Mashamhanda and Masimba Kambarami, as they are helping the club in many ways. “There is so much support from the trustees that they sponsor some of the tournaments and that is well appreciated. “The membership has remained the same. “The other aspect is that the former board is rallying behind me and I always consult Eddie Murungweni, and Kennedy Chokuda, whenever we want to make crucial decisions. “We are working as a team and I give thanks to the board who are making my work even easier. “It is not easy to run a big club like Falcon but, with everyone’s support, things can be done.’’ Mashanhanda and Kamabarami usually sponsor some golf days.
