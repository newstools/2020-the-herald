The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter BORROWDALE Park will come alive, under strict conditions tomorrow afternoon, after the Sports Commission gave them a chance to stage the race meeting which was cancelled last week. Last week’s race meeting was cancelled after a breach of Covid-19 protocols that had appeared on social media. Mashonaland Turf club appealed successfully against the decision. The MTC continued to lobby the relevant authorities for a swift return to safe racing and reaffirmed their support for the measures taken by the Government to fight the spread of this virus. The MTC issued a statement, confirming the resumption of the race meeting, saying they will follow standard procedures. “Please be advised that as at 12 o’clock today (yesterday), the SRC has approved racing at Borrowdale Park for Sunday August 16, albeit under stricter and monitored conditions,’’ read the statement. ‘’The conditions will include that no person will be allowed into the parade ring other than the trainer and jockey at any time (including post-race). ‘’Jockeys and trainers are to wear masks at all times after leaving jockey room until re-entering the change room. “Owners will be segregated on the third floor with a maximum of 50 people and any breach of these conditions will result in the offender being removed from the racecourse.’’ The race meeting will come back after last week’s cancelation in which MTC chairman, Gary Carter, was forced to make a last-minute announcement of the official postponement, and cancellation, of the scheduled race. ‘’On Friday the MTC were informed by the Sports and Recreation Council that approval was denied to hold the race meeting on Sunday 9th August. ‘’The MTC appealed that decision on the grounds that it was an isolated blemish on an otherwise very successful implementation of the Covid-19 guidelines over the last three months.’’
