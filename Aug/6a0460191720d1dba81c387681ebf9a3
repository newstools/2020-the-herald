WITH time not on their side, the Rainbow Amateur Netball League may have to look at other options to complete their season. This follows the suspension of league games, just after three rounds of matches, in March. The league usually runs from March to November. Netball was classified among the high-risk sport codes and it’s not certain when they will be allowed back in action. RANL secretary-general, Moses Gukurume, said they wete still consulting with their stakeholders on the best possible way forward. “With the current situation, we have not yet managed to get hold of some of the people,’’ he said. “Clubs are divided on a lot of things, managers have their views, and coaches have their views. But, ultimately, everything is hinged on how much we can get and when? “The playing format, we do it in consultation with how much we need, for example if we go for a tournament format, how much do we need? “We have to come up with a document, sit with the sponsor to say if we are allowed to resume, how much do we need? “The main issue zeroes on how much we can get at a particular time.” There is also need to consider clubs, as they have to come up with their budgets, to meet the expenses from their part. “Some are of the idea that we play two Cup Games, with everyone participating, and the league is done and dusted,’’ he said. ‘‘Some are saying let’s go to next year but the issue is our sponsorship expires this year. ‘‘So, we are still to decide on the way forward, consultation is still going on. “There is also the issue of clubs, for example, if they need to travel, let’s say three times a week, are they able to meet the costs? “We just hope this situation gets better because time is not on our side.’’ Although some clubs are well sponsored, others are already struggling due to financial constraints. Last year, some clubs failed to complete their matches.
