The Herald Court Reporter A Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) employee yesterday appeared in court facing allegations of conniving with her workmate and forging documents used to import and evade paying duty for a luxury car belonging to Zanu PF legislator for Magunje, Cecil Kashiri. Yvonne Mangwende (31) appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Barbra Mateko charged with fraud. She was not asked to plead to the charges and was remanded out of custody to November 16 on $3 000 bail. Kashiri (49) has since appeared in court on similar charges. He was also freed on $3 000 bail. Prosecutor Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti alleges that between September and December 31 last year, Kashiri allegedly hatched a plan to defraud Zimra by importing a Ford Ranger from South Africa without paying customs duty. It is alleged that on September 4, Kashiri in connivance with a customs officer, Norest Ushe, who is yet to be arrested, used a bill of entry for goods imported by Murowa Diamonds dated February 2019, to import the Ford Ranger from South Africa for personal use. The forged documents were used to process a customs clearance certificate for the vehicle.
