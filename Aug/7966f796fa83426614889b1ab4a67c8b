Abdul has been known for evading police arrests and escaping shootouts in which some of his accomplices were killed by police in several incidents in and around the city. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-503013 size-large" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Untitled-4-7-299x680.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="680" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Untitled-4-7-299x680.jpg 299w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Untitled-4-7-158x360.jpg 158w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Untitled-4-7.jpg 680w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" />
