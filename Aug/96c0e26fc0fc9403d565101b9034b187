The Herald LONDON. — Aaron Ramsey is not wanted by Andrea Pirlo at Italian Serie A football giants Juventus and is free to find another club. The Welsh star, who joined Juventus on a free transfer last summer, is surplus to requirements under the new regime. Ramsey (29) started only 11 Serie A matches last season. But his wages of £250 000-a-week limit his options. Pirlo was announced as the new Juventus head coach on Sunday to replace Maurizio Sarri. The Italian also wants to offload Gonzalo Higuain, Sami Khedira, Daniele Rugani and Mattia De Sciglio, while Blaise Matuidi is already set to move on. France World Cup winner Matuidi underwent a medical with David Beckham’s Inter Miami on Monday before signing a three-year deal. Beckham knows Matuidi from playing together at Paris Saint-Germain. Inter Miami have lost their first five MLS matches and scored only three goals, but the acquisition of Matuidi would represent a first marquee signing for the newly-formed franchise. Matuidi’s departure does lessen the competition for places in Juventus’ central midfield positions, but Ramsey still has the likes of Adrien Rabiot, Rodrigo Bentancur and the incoming Arthur Melo to contend with. However Pirlo is expected to invest in his squad this summer in a bid to mount a serious challenge for the Champions League. One player who continues to be linked with a return to Turin is Man Utd midfielder Paul Pogba. In the past a potential swap deal involving Ramsey and Pogba has been mooted, but United have no ideas about selling their star player. — The Mirror.
