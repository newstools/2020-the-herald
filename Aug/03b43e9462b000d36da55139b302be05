FORMER Petrozim Line (Pvt) Ltd general manager Cathrene Katsande (55) yesterday spent another night in custody after trial magistrate Mr Lazini Ncube failed to attend court to sentence her as he was attending to other business. Mr Ncube is now expected to hand down the sentence today. Katsande was convicted of six counts of fraudulently awarding US$2Â million worth of tenders for equipment delivered to the fuel company during her tenure of office. Katsande was convicted along with Kaltrade (Pvt) Limited, which was being represented by its managing director Zadzisai Zacharia. The court established that on June 24, 2013, Katsande authorised a payment of US$159 925 after Keltrade had submitted a quotation indicating that it had capacity to supply a gearbox for 10 gate valves. The money was paid before Keltrade supplied the goods. On September 24 of the same year, she also authorised payment of US$610 640 to Keltrade after it indicated that it had capacity to supply two skid pumps. On the third occasion on December 9, 2013, Katsande advanced US$363 860 after Keltrade had supplied a quotation indicating that it was in position to supply two ethanol centrifugal pumps. The money was paid before the pumps were supplied. In February 2015, Katsande authorised payment of US$91 082 after Keltrade gave her a quotation for drag resistant spares. In the same month, Katsande authorised payments of various amounts to Keltrade without following proper procedures. In March of the same year, one Mr I Mubaiwa wrote to Katsande advising her to purchase goods from MIS Solutions, but she disregarded the recommendation and gave the tender to Keltrade. The court established that after flouting the procedures, she authorised payment of US$156 435 and US$262 760 for the supply of other pumps after Keltrade had only supplied a quotation.
