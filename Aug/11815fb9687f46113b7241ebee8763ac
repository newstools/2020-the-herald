The Herald LONDON. — Jadon Sancho is on the verge of finalising his personal terms with Manchester United. United are edging closer to landing their No 1 target, England winger Sancho, from Borussia Dortmund in a deal that is set to reach £108 million. And while the clubs remain locked in talks over what would be a stunning club and English record transfer, Sancho’s wages and the terms of what is expected to be an initial five-year deal are almost agreed. The two clubs have been in advanced discussions for some time over the deal that will see Sancho, 20, return to Manchester, having left Manchester City for Germany three years ago. Those discussions are continuing and centre on the structure of the deal with Dortmund sticking to their £108m asking price. Dortmund want at least half of that up front and negotiations will continue this week about how the total package is made up though all parties are optimistic an agreement will be reached. Sancho’s current Dortmund deal, due to run until 2022, is worth in the region of £190,000-per week and he can expect a considerable pay hike. — Mailonline.
