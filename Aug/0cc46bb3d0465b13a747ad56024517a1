The Herald LONDON. — Chelsea’s preparations for the new football season have been thrown into turmoil after they were hit by a coronavirus outbreak. The west London club confirmed a number of players have tested positive for Covid-19 and are in quarantine to limit the threat of further spreading among Frank Lampard’s squad. England stars Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham plus two of their club-mates are in quarantine amid a Covid-19 outbreak at Chelsea. Defender Fikayo Tomori (22) and winger Christian Pulisic (21) are also in isolation under Government guidelines. All four went on holiday to the Greek island of Mykonos before pre-season training began last weekend. Abraham (22), Pulisic and Tomori even posed for pictures together as they relaxed in the sunshine. None of them reported for duty at the Blues’ Surrey training ground yet in order to minimise the risk of any potential infection. Chelsea would not comment on whether the players involved have tested positive or negative for coronavirus but it is known there are a number of cases at the club. The club are now adhering to official protocols and guidelines to maintain the bio-secure bubble around the first-team squad. The new season starts for Chelsea in less than three weeks’ time so it is a big blow for boss Frank Lampard. Abraham and 21-year-old Mount’s quarantine also throws up issues for England boss Gareth Southgate who has named both players in his 24-man Uefa Nations League squad. Two of their un-named Three Lions team-mates have already tested positive for coronavirus after holidaying on the Greek islands. Mykonos is part of Greece which does not require a mandatory period in quarantine upon return to the UK. But if anyone has been in contact with someone who is positive while there, they must stay home for seven days. — Mailonline.
