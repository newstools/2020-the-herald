The Herald Freedom Mupanedemo Midlands Bureau Barely a few months after it appeared as if machete gangs that terrorised gold mining areas had been contained after a major operation, a team of robbers armed with machetes and knobkerries raided the Circle V Mine in Shurugwi and stole a firearm and US$5 000 cash, stabbing and injuring an employee in the process. Management said the money was part of the float used to buy gold at the mine. Officer-in-Charge for Shurugwi Police Station, Inspector Navison Munyonga, confirmed the robbery. “Initially, two men who pretended to be clients approached the security guard and asked how much they would get for the 20 grammes of gold they had,” said Mr Luckson Masuku, a supervisor at the mine. “The security guard told them the offices had been closed, but they drew nearer to him showing what they were claiming to be the 20g of gold they intended to sell at the mine.” Mr Masuku said the two suddenly attacked the security guard and wrestled away his firearm. “Meanwhile, their colleagues who were armed with machetes arrived and tied up the security guard who was now defenceless,” he said. “They broke into an office and got away with US$5 000 cash.” Mr Masuku said one of the mine workers was injured after he tried to resist orders from the suspects. “They told the other mine workers who were present to lie down, but one employee who attempted to resist was stabbed and sustained injuries,” he said. Mr Masuku said the matter was reported at Shurugwi Police Station, who attended to the scene. “Officer in charge Shurugwi Inspector Navison Munyonga came to the scene with armed police, but the suspects had already disappeared,” he said. “There has not been any arrests so far.” On Thursday, Midlands provincial police spokesperson, Inspector Joel Goko, said he was still to get the details of the incident.
