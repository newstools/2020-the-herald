The Herald SAN FRANCISCO. — A pack of former major champions was chasing first round co-leaders Jason Day and Brendon Todd as the second round of the PGA Championship got underway at the TPC Harding Park here yesterday. Both shot opening rounds of five-under 65 but were being pursued by a star-studded pack that includes two-time defending PGA champ Brooks Koepka. The group of nine players tied for third also included former golf major champions Zach Johnson, England’s Justin Rose and Germany’s Martin Kaymer. Another group of eight at three under includes reigning US Open champion Gary Woodland, with 15-time major champion Tiger Woods and long-hitting Bryson DeChambeau, who shot opening-round 68s. The conditions were ideal yesterday morning with the sun starting to shine through the clouds, as players teed off in the first major championship since the coronavirus pandemic shut down professional sports in America in mid-March. Todd’s stellar first round came in the late afternoon Thursday, as the winds finally started whipping and conditions toughened. That was reversed yesterday as Todd and DeChambeau were part of the morning wave while Day, Koepka, Woods and world No 1 Justin Thomas all had afternoon tee times. Day is looking for his first win of 2020 but has had strong performances in his last three events while Todd has already won twice this season. Eleven players shot 66 or better on Thursday, setting a new opening-round total for one                            major. China’s Li Haotong got off to a hot start yesterday, making birdies at three of his first five holes to move to six under for the tournament. — AFP.
