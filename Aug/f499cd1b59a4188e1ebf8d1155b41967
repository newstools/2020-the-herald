The Herald PARIS. — Belgium international Romelu Lukaku is closing in on an Inter Milan record in European football competition held by Cameroon great Samuel Eto’o. The striker was on target in the Italians’ 2-1 defeat of Bayer Leverkusen in Monday’s Europa League quarter-final fixture. With Nicolo Barella giving Antonio Conte’s men a 15th-minute lead at Merkur Spielarena in Dusseldorf, Lukaku added the second six minutes later to send his team into the last four of the competition. Thanks to this, the Belgian star has now been directly involved in nine goals in the European tournament for the San Siro giants this season — with six goals and three assists — excluding qualifiers. African football icon Eto’o holds the record of the most involvements for Inter in a single season, which he achieved during the 2010-11 campaign when he scored eight goals and provided five assists. Apart from taking his tally in all competitions to 31 goals this season, the former Chelsea, Everton and Manchester United man broke two records against the Bundesliga outfit. — Goal.com
