The Herald LONDON. – Manchester United skipper Harry Maguire has been arrested on the Greek island of Mykonos following an incident outside a nightclub involving local police, according to reports. Local outlet OEMA claim the England international was involved in a heated row with fellow British tourists while enjoying a night out. When confronted by officers, three individuals were said to have responded with physical and verbal abuse. Police made three arrests in the early hours of yesterday morning, with Magurie reportedly among those detained. Manchester United said in a statement: “The club is aware of an alleged incident involving Harry Maguire in Mykonos last night. “Contact has been made with Harry, and he is fully co-operating with the Greek authorities. “At this time we will be making no further comment.” Maguire joined United from Leicester City 12 months ago in what was a world record transfer for a centre-half. The 27-year-old established himself as a key component of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side and was made club captain following the departure of Antonio Valencia. Maguire’s fiancee, Fern Hawkins, posted a picture of the pair in Mykonos on her Instagram page on Thursday night. The couple have two baby daughters, the youngest of which was born in May. United’s season came to a disappointing end last Sunday when they were beaten 2-1 in the semi-finals of the Europa League by Sevilla. The majority of the first team squad are now enjoying holidays abroad before first team training resumes next week, with the new English Premier League campaign due to resume in three week’s time. – Metro.
