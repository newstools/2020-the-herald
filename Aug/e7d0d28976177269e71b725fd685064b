The Herald LONDON. — Joe Bryan’s superb extra-time double sent Fulham back to the English Premier League on Tuesday night and riches which other clubs in the world can only imagine. Fulham beat Brentford 2-1 in the English Championship play-off final at Wembley Stadium. The second-tier promotion game is the richest prize in English football and is set to be worth around US$250 million. And if Fulham avoids relegation next season, the club stands to make an additional US$480 million of revenue over the next five years, predominantly through EPL broadcast deals. Fulham coach Scott Parker says the triumph was “emotional” after “ups and downs” following the club’s relegation from the Premier League last season. “I’m the face who fronts up but behind the scenes is a support network of people that keep you going in those times and those moments,” Parker said. “That’s why I feel emotional, I feel for the people who aren’t here, the people who’ve supported the team and me as manager, sometimes you’ve not always got that and I’m very proud of my team, so, so proud of them.” — www.7news.com.au
