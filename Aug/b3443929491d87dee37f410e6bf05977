The Herald MANCHESTER. — Pakistan’s Babar Azam underlined his status as one of the world’s leading batsmen with a fine unbeaten fifty against England on an interrupted opening day of the first test at Old Trafford yesterday. When bad light forced an early close, Pakistan were 139-2, with Babar 69 not out and Shan Masood unbeaten on 46. But, left-handed opener Masood was twice missed on 45 by England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler either side of a lengthy rain break, with offspinner Dom Bess the unlucky bowler on both occasions. The prolific Babar has now reached a half-century in five successive test innings, with his previous five matches yielding four hundreds. Former England captain Nasser Hussain, commentating for Sky Sports, said Babar could be considered alongside players such as India captain Virat Kohli. “If this lad was Virat Kohli, everyone would be talking about it but because it is Babar Azam, no one is talking about it,” said Hussain. “He’s young, he’s elegant, he’s got all the swagger,” he added. — Reuters.
