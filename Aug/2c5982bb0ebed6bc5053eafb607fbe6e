The Herald NEW YORK. — Serena Williams said there were “really no excuses” as she was knocked out of the Western and Southern Open tennis tournament in the third round by Greek Maria Sakkari on Tuesday. Williams also likened the frustration she felt in Tuesday’s shock defeat by  Sakkari at the Western and Southern Open to that of being stuck in a bad relationship. Thirteenth seed Sakkari had trailed by a set and a break before beating the American 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1. Sakkari will play Britain’s Johanna Konta in the quarter-finals. “It was tough,” said Williams, who will chase a seventh US Open singles title next week. “I literally should have won that match. There was no excuse. “It was hard, but I had so many opportunities to win, and I have to figure that one out, like how to start winning those matches again. “There is really no excuses, to be honest.” Third seed Williams (38) had started the match at pace, racing into a 5-2 lead after an early break of serve. But Sakkari, facing the 23-time Grand Slam champion for the first time, was then able to settle, levelling the first set at 5-5 before Williams took the next two games. It was Sakkari who earned the early break in the second set, going 3-1 up but Williams won the next four games to find herself serving for the match, moving just two points from victory before her opponent was able to break back and go on to send the match into a decider. From then on, the world number 21 controlled proceedings as frustration got the better of Williams, surging 5-0 ahead before wrapping up the win. — AFP.
