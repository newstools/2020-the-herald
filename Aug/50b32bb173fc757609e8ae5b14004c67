SCHOOLS sport is reeling this year after being halted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the competitions affected include the country’s biggest schools football tournament, Copa Coca-Cola, the Tanganda netball competition for the Under-17s, under the Stella brand, as well as the Proton and Surrey boys Under-20 football tourney. National Association of Secondary School Heads and National Association of Primary School Heads athletics inter-provincials meet have also been affected. Some of these events are used to select teams for different age-groups that compete at regional events such as the Confederation of Schools Sport Association of Southern Africa. Nash president, Arthur Maphosa, said there is very little they can do under the circumstances. “Our sporting calendar has been affected big time, this has had a big negative impact that could even derail the dreams of some athletes,’’ he said. “We compete in age groups, this means some age groups like the Under-20 have lost their opportunity to compete at school level for the last time. ‘’Some athletes have lost the opportunity to compete at regional level like Cossasa, both athletics and ball games. “Be that as it may, we value the lives of our children and teachers, there will be life after Covid-19. “The way forward will stand guided by the Government as to when schools re-open and we will take it from there.’’ Some of their events had received support from the corporate world despite the challenges. “Our sponsors are keen to continue with us, and I have no doubt that our sponsorship will not be affected by the pandemic, after a storm comes calm,’’ he said.
