Ivorian football legend, Didier Drogba, addressing a crowd of hysterical fans, brought life to a halt in parts of Abidjan at the weekend when he arrived to file his papers for the presidency of the country’s football federation. — Kick-Off The Elephants legend was initially embarrassed in the first round of voting against the trio when he earned no vote from 14 former national team players for his ambitious “Renaissance Project”. His bid to revolutionise Ivorian football then took another major blow in July when the Cote d’lvoire Footballers Association refused to sponsor his presidential bid. But, the Chelsea legend is seemingly unperturbed by the major setbacks as he spoked eloquently to the media amidst the masses that were sent into a frenzy upon his arrival to submit his bed for the elections set to take place on Septemeber 5. “Football is everyone’s sport, football brings people together, football unites. We can see it today with all these people gathered in front of the headquarters of the Ivorian football federation,” Drogba said. “It’s no secret that our football is going badly, and that is why with my team we are committed to contributing to the rebirth of Ivorian football. — KickOff.com
