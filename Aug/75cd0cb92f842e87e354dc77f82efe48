The Herald LISBON. — Pep Guardiola admitted Manchester City shot themselves in the foot once more in the Champions League football after crashing out in the quarter-finals for the third straight season with a shock 3-1 defeat to Lyon in Lisbon. A familiar cocktail of defensive errors, missed chances and VAR controversy did for Guardiola’s side with the Catalan coach also under fire for another surprise team selection in the knockout stages. Guardiola is yet to get beyond the last eight in his four years in charge of City as the English side’s wait to be crowned champions of Europe continues despite the billions invested by the club’s Abu Dhabi owners. “One day we’ll break this gap to the quarter-finals,” said Guardiola. “The second half was OK, I had a feeling we were better but you have to be perfect in these competitions. “I don’t want to talk about the circumstances (of Dembele’s first goal), it looks like I’m complaining or finding excuses. We are out. We did a lot of good things and in the end it was not enough. “You have to be perfect in these competitions in one game and we weren’t. We made mistakes in both boxes at key moments and that’s why we are out. — AFP.
