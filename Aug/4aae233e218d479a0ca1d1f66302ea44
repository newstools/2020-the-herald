The Herald Sports Reporter HARARE Businessman and staunch Dynamos supporter Ben Choto has died. Choto, who owned the Mutangadura businesses, died in Harare at the weekend after a short illness. Funeral arrangements were still sketchy yesterday but mourners were gathered at his farm near Goromonzi turnoff. Former Dynamos chairman Simon Makaza described Choto as a staunch Dynamos supporter. Makaza said football was left poorer following his demise. DeMbare cheerleader Chris “Romario” Musekiwa also mourned one of their colleagues. “We are saddened to hear about this tragic news,” said Musekiwa. “I actually met him two weeks ago and just like anyone else he was lamenting the absence of football due to Covid-19. He always said football was a form of escape from the stresses of daily life and the pressure associated with running businesses.” Condolence messages continued to pour in yesterday with former ZIFA board member Francis Zimunya also sending his words of comfort to the family.
