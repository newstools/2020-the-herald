ZIMBABWE Tertiary Institutions Sports Union president, Olivartha Guriro, says they have cancelled all regional tournaments scheduled for this year. The country was supposed to take part at the Confederation of Universities and Colleges Sports Association in Lesotho from July 28 to August 4. However, the tournament was cancelled because of the Covid-19 outbreak. “We could not hold the qualifiers for this year’s CUCSA Games due to the coronavirus pandemic and we have since cancelled all programmes for this year,’’ said Guriro. “The calendar will end without any tournaments being held as we follow the health directives. “There were several sporting activities, which were lined up from the beginning of the year, but there is nothing we can do now. “At first, we had rescheduled our final qualifiers to December after the institutions briefly re-opened but, since the students are now back home, there is nothing we can do.’’ Zimbabwe hosted the Games in 2016 and Botswana were the hosts in 2018 before the Lesotho Games were put on hold.
