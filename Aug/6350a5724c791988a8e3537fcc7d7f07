The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Cricket South Africa director of cricket, Graeme Smith, has again defended his decision to appoint Mark Boucher as head coach of the Proteas. In December 2019, shortly after Smith was named interim DOC, Boucher was unveiled as head coach of the national side, less than two weeks out from the four-Test visit from England. He was handed a contract until the end of the 2023 World Cup. Boucher’s credentials included that he enjoyed a successful period as coach of the Titans, but it did not prevent his qualifications — he possesses a Level 2 coaching certificate — being brought to the fore. Current Cape Cobras coach Ashwell Prince, for example, has upskilled and currently possesses a Level 3 coaching certificate. On Saturday, Smith spoke out in a wide-ranging press conference, where he addressed what he considered to be unfair suggestions in the media that there were irregularities in both his appointment and that of Boucher.  CSA president, Chris Nenzani, has also come out in defence of those appointments, saying both were approved by the board. ‘’I think Mark has done enough coaching at domestic level and he has had a lot of success,’’ said Smith. ‘’I feel that his personality and international experience is what was required at the time. “In partnering with Enoch (Nkwe, assistant coach), I feel that the two of them can form a really strong partnership going forward. I feel that was an important dynamic that needed to be respected and thought of at the time. — Sport24
