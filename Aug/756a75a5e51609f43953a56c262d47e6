The Herald LONDON — Manchester United star Paul Pogba is the latest Premier League player to test positive for coronavirus after Chelsea’s pre-season preparations were thrown into chaos by six players contracting the infection. Pogba, United’s £89 million record signing, will now have to spend 14 days in self-isolation, meaning he will miss the start of the pre-season preparations next Wednesday. World Cup winner Pogba, 27, had remained in England during his time off and was pictured enjoying a night out at the swanky Cipriani Restaurant in London on Saturday night with his heavily pregnant wife Maria Zulay Salaues and friends. United are the latest Premier League club to be hit with a coronavirus setback and told Sportsmail: “Paul has been replaced in the French squad after testing positive for Covid-19. Everybody at United wishes him a speedy recovery ahead of the new season.’’ The news comes after Chelsea confirmed a number of players have tested positive for Covid-19 and are in quarantine to limit the threat of further spreading among Frank Lampard’s squad. Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham, Christian Pulisic and Fikayo Tomori are all understood to be in self-isolation after they were pictured on holiday on the Greek island of Mykonos before pre-season training began last weekend. Pogba’s positive test will come as a bitter blow for United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who is also expected to be without Aaron Wan-Bissaka for the beginning of their pre-season training after he failed to follow his club’s advice by travelling to Dubai. As Sportsmail revealed, the England ace flew to the popular holiday destination at the end of United’s season and must now self-isolate for 14 days upon his return.— Mailonline.
