The Herald Diversified financial services  company Zimnat has extended its arm into South Africa to enable  Zimbabweans living there to take out funeral insurance, including the cost of bringing their bodies back home should they die in that country. Zimnat Group chief executive officer Mustafa Sachak said they had been  moved by the plight of Zimbabweans dying in South Africa, whose families  were unable to afford the cost of repatriating bodies. “We believe that we all deserve a decent burial, regardless of where we  are. An estimated between one and three million Zimbabweans are  currently living and working in South Africa and it is our  responsibility as an organisation to make their life better through  ensuring they maintain their dignity even in death,” he said. There have been reports of some Zimbabweans smuggling bodies of their  dead relatives into the country since the cost of the journey back home  for burial falls beyond the reach of many. — New Ziana.
