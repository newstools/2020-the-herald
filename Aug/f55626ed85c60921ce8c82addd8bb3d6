A top official of a national employment council yesterday appeared in court facing charges of fraudulently transferring ownership of a council vehicle to his workmate after misrepresenting that the colleague had repaid a loan for the vehicle. The alleged fraudulent act prejudiced the organisation of US$138 000. Administrator of the National Employment Council for the Engineering, Iron and Steel Industry, Canaan Mugadza (52), appeared at the Harare Magistrates’ Courts yesterday charged with fraud. Harare provincial magistrate Mrs Vongai Guriro remanded him to September 4 on $1 000 bail. State counsel Mr George Manokore said Mugadza was responsible for all administrative work at his organisation, including monitoring assets and the payroll under the guidelines set in the NEC’s constitution and executive committee resolutions. On February 24, 2018, Mugadza wrote to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) seeking registration of a Toyota Hilux double cab into the name of Pumulani Musangwiza who, he said, had repaid a vehicle purchase loan from the NEC for the Engineering, Iron and Steel Industry. The State alleges that Mugadza knew that Musangwiza had not repaid the loan. On March 19, 2018, Zimra acting on the misrepresentation, cleared and registered the car into Musangwiza’s name under a new registration number.
