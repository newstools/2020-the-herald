UNIVERSITY Of Zimbabwe director of sport, Life Chemhere, believes they had improved a lot, in several sports codes, before the national lockdown. UZ were the domestic volleyball champions and were set to represent the Southern Region in the Africa Games which were cancelled. “We are concerned with the pandemic, it has affected everyone and, as UZ, we had travelled a long way, especially during the past year,’’ said Chemhere. “We had several sports codes which we did well but we failed to showcase our full potential due to the current lockdown. “The year 2019 had a lot of positives as we managed to win the Zone Six Volleyball Championships in Malawi with the men’s team winning the tournament, and a ticket to next year’s African Club Championships.’’ The Wolves beat counterparts Harare City 3-2, with the two clubs qualifying for the continental showcase in Tunisia. University of Zimbabwe women’s team had to settle for the bronze and also booked their ticket for the Africa showpiece. “The netball team had managed to secure a slot in the Super League, after we did well in Division One, and we were looking forward to playing in the top-flight. “We, will, however remain solid and focused.’’
