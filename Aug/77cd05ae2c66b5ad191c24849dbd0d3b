They then went out and drove away with the cash amounting to US$306 000 and over R100 000,” said Asst Comm Nyathi. “We appeal to members of the public who might have information, which could be of help in tracking down and arresting the suspects, to approach the nearest police station,” he said. Meanwhile, police close to investigations yesterday said the two left all the company uniforms, guns and bullets including R210 000 in the van. But the US dollars were missing. <img class="size-full wp-image-501189" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/1308-1-1-LEON-KAHOKA.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/1308-1-1-LEON-KAHOKA.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/1308-1-1-LEON-KAHOKA-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Leon Kahoka They said the rands were found in the cash box. “What is surprising is that they left some of the money in the van, about R210 000,” said the police source.
