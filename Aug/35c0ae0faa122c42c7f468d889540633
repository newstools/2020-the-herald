The Herald LONDON. — Lionel Messi has reportedly rocked new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman by telling him he doesn’t see a future for the Catalan club. Messi has been strongly liked with a move away from the Camp Nou this summer following Barcelona’s 8-2 demolition at the hands of Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Barcelona have shuffled the pack following the defeat with boss Quique Setien and sporting director Eric Abidal leaving, and Koeman being named the club’s new head coach. A number of high-profile players are also in contention to be sold, although Messi is not among these names, and president Josep Maria Bartomeu may stand down. But despite the club trying to make positive changes, Messi isn’t convinced it’s going to help. According to RAC1, Messi recently spoke with Koeman and allowed the Dutchman to explain his plans for Barcelona. But Messi told the Dutchman he doesn’t see a clear future for the club he has represented since the age of eight, suggesting he may see himself elsewhere. Victor Font is in the running to succeed Bartomeu at Barcelona, and recently spoke out about the Messi predicament. Font believes there is a real possibility the Argentine could leave the club in this summer’s transfer window, and admits it would be a nightmare for the club. Messi apparently ended his summer holiday early for the heart-to-heart on Thursday. And the legendary forward added that he sees himself more “out of the club than in it.” Messi has long been thought to be unhappy at Barcelona following turmoil on and off the pitch. — The Mirror.
