The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Kaizer Chiefs will grind with everything they have for a second huge South African Premiership victory against Mamelodi Sundowns. The two giants meet in the 2019-20 season’s title race decider at Orlando Stadium this evening. With the gap having been whittled to just three points‚ Chiefs know they can relinquish their advantage in the championship battle should they lose. The Amakosi were not given hope of a victory in the corresponding away fixture in October but they won 2-0. That victory signalled the Soweto giants would challenge for the title in their 50th anniversary season. “When we played them in the first round people never gave us a chance‚” said skipper Willard Katsande. “And, we knew what we wanted, and we knew that if we applied the tactics that the coach told us we were going to come out victorious‚ and we would have been good visitors at the capital city. “Going into this match‚ we know what’s at stake. We just want to try to improve‚ keep going forward‚ keep on doing well. “Because, we started this journey when everyone was not even giving us a chance as we were coming from a bad season not even finishing in the top eight. “So, we just need to approach this match with respect to our opposition. At the same time that we are calm‚ we are very aggressive. “We know what’s at stake. We are still in control. It’s up to us what we are going to dish in this match. “But, the most important thing is that it’s not about skill‚ it’s not about experience — it’s about who wants it more for that particular time.’’ He said his men should give it all they have. “So, we just need to put our hearts in and just go and grind. And, if they run 3‚000‚ we need to run 5‚000 kilometres to grind the result. “Because the most important thing is that we really want the result‚ and we are going to work hard for it.” Chiefs (53 points from 26 matches) at one stage had a 13-point lead over Sundowns (50 from 26) in December. — TimesAlive.
