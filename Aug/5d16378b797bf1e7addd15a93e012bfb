The Herald LONDON. — Paul Pogba’s agent Mino Raiola has stated that the Manchester United midfielder will be remaining at Old Trafford this summer. The 27-year-old has just one year left on his deal at the Theatre of Dreams, leading to reported interest from Real Madrid and Juventus. There were even rumours that Pogba could be involved in a swap deal with Juventus star Paulo Dybala. But SunSport exclusively revealed in July how the World Cup winner was to remain at United with the club keen to tie him down for five years. And now Raiola has confirmed that Pogba is going nowhere this transfer window, with contract talks set to take place. Speaking to Sky Sport Italia, he said: “Paul Pogba will stay at Manchester United. “Pogba is key player for Man Utd, they have an important project and he’s 100 per cent included. “Man Utd will not accept any bid this summer to sell Pogba. We’re going to speak about a new contract soon, no stress.” Ole Gunnar Solskjaer earlier this month spoke of his optimism that Pogba will commit his future to the Red Devils. He said: “Since coming back from injury he has been a delight. He has worked really hard, he is happy and he is playing well. “We are going to see the best of Paul in the next couple of seasons, I’m sure. And I’m looking forward to seeing him grow with this team. “He will have to be one of the leaders, one of the main figures, because he is just coming to his peak time as a footballer at 27. “I am really looking forward to working with him.” — The Sun.
