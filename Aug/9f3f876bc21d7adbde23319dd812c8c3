The Herald LONDON. — Daniel Sturridge has exclusively told Sky Sports News that he has “unfinished business” and wants to return to the English Premier League football. The former England striker has been out of the game since leaving Turkish side Trabzonspor in March after being handed a four-month ban for breaching the FA’s gambling regulations. But Sturridge has maintained his training schedule at his base in Los Angeles and says he is ready to attack the next chapter in his career. “We have options around the world but I’m an English player and I’ve always loved playing in the Premier League,” he said. “I believe I’ve got a lot to give to the Premier League and I would say that’s my first choice. I do feel I have unfinished business so I would like to go back and play there. “I’m open to playing in other leagues, it’s not just the Premier League I’m going to consider, but to come back to England and give my best would be a huge option for me. — AFP.
