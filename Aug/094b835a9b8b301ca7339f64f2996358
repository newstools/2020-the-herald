The Herald Gold fell as much as 1,6 percent last Friday as the dollar bounced back, denting bullion’s appeal and setting it on track for a second straight weekly decline. Spot gold  fell 0,3 percent to $1,937.81 per ounce by 1322 GMT, while US gold futures dropped 0,4 percent to $1,937.80 per ounce. For the week, gold is down 0,3 percent, having slumped more than 3 percent earlier this week. “The dollar has made a lot ground over the past few days and it really has taken the edge off gold,” said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam, adding that while on the upside $2 000 is now a big barrier and $1 860 could be a bit of test prior to that. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar gained 0,6 percent, making gold more expensive for holders of other currencies. “For the time being we have seen the high in gold . . . until something happens either on the US stimulus front in terms of the relief package or the US-China tensions take a very positive or negative turn,” said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. Bullion’s fall came despite data signalling the euro zone’s economic recovery from its deepest downturn on record stalled this month. —  Reuters.
