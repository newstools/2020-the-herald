The Herald LONDON. — We will soon see football legend Paul Gascoigne’s triumphs and tears kick off all over again – on the big screen. A planned film will cover the 53-year-old’s career but also focus on his life off-pitch, including his alcohol addiction. The team is using his memoirs to craft the script, including Gazza: My Story – the book he wrote 16 years ago with biographer Hunter Davies. And producers are already scouting for a star signing to play the former Tottenham, Lazio and England ace. Insisting the flick will tell things warts and all, Gazza said: “Let’s face it, I have nothing to hide. It has all been in the press, the good and bad.” The news comes as a documentary using footage of Italia 90, Euro 96 and his three years in Italy with Lazio is due out. Speaking to the Mirror near his Bournemouth home, Gazza said: “The documentary is out in November. The makers have spoken to me and my family. “But there are backers looking at a film and trying to find someone to play me. I will guide them and read the script, it will be about my entire life. They will use my books.” Fans can expect to see iconic moments including Gazza’s on-pitch tears as Germany booted the Three Lions out of the 1990 World Cup in the semis. Fun incidents it could take in include Vinnie Jones demonstrating some unorthodox ball control on him in a 1988 match – and his hilarious “dentist’s chair” goal celebration during Euro 96. But the film is also expected to cover his rehab and 1998 marriage split with Sheryl, 54. And other dramas it could tackle include the court case last year in which he was cleared of a sexual assault claim. Recalling the height of Gazzamania after Italia 90, Gazza said: “It is all right becoming famous. It was incredible. Gazza admitted he lost a £15million fortune “and the rest” — but insisted he has no regrets. — The Mirror.
