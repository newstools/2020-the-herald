The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal fans fear Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will leave the English Premiership football club this summer following an Instagram post by the striker’s father on the final day of the Premier League season. Earlier last week, reports claimed Arsenal are set to offer the 31-year-old a deal worth £250 000 a week to stay at the club. But, following Arsenal’s 3-2 victory against Watford on Sunday, Aubameyang’s father, Pierre-Francois, posted a cryptic message. “My son, who wouldn’t be proud to have a son like you. Bravo, bravo, bravo,” Aubameyang (Snr) posted on Instagram. “You really are a scorer. Every season you respond with your efficiency, last season 22 goals, this season 22 goals. I can only congratulate you and tell you once again my pride. “We must make the right decision for the rest of your career. They speak a lot in the press, they do not know that we are Bantu and that there is a hierarchy the decision is taken after the advice of the wise man who is your father. We will be set very soon, sleep peacefully my son, your father watches the grain. I love you.” Aubameyang’s father also made a similar reference to “watching the grain” shortly after the striker had secured his move from Borussia Dortmund to Arsenal in January 2018. “I am never far, because it is very important to accompany your children and to take care of the grain, I harvest what I have sown,” Aubameyang’s father posted on Instagram shortly after his son’s arrival at Arsenal. “A big thank you to Michael Zorc, to the president and to the whole Dortmund family without forgetting the fans for allowing the improvement of this seed, thank you again for all.” — Metro.
