DYNAMOS gate marshal, Todd Gwamure, has died. He was 60. Gwamure, who was the brother to the late former Chapungu United defensive midfielder Beaven Gwamure, died at Sally Mugabe Hospital on Thursday. He had initially complained of a headache. Todd was also a founder member of the Mbare social football club, Zhunde. The club had a galaxy of fine players such as the late Jim Brown, Raphael “Tsano” Beira, Big George Nyamulani (late), former Dynamos midfielder Reuben Musambudzi, Leonard “Waga-Waga” Sande (late) and David Madure. Todd’s football career was cut short in an accident, which led to the amputation of his left hand. Gwamure’s brother, David Samukange, described the death as a huge blow to the family and the football community. “I can confirm that Todd Gwamure has passed away. He died yesterday (Thursday) at Sally Mugabe Hospital,’’ said Samukange. “He was complaining of a headache, we have lost a pillar of strength as he was someone we looked up to. “He tried a career in football, in the late ‘70s when he turned out for the Dynamos juniors and, by the time he was about to be promoted to the senior team, he had a freak accident which led to the amputation of his hand.’’ Veteran football commentator, Charles “CNN” Mabika, said Gwamure was a promising player during his youth. “He was actually a left winger who had graduated from the Dynamos juniors and was ready to move to the senior team until a horrific accident cost him part of his left arm,” said Mabika. Mourners are gathered at Number 58, Vito Street, in Mbare.
