A SERIAL rapist who allegedly raped 11 women on separate occasions, whom he had offered a lift appeared in court yesterday. Gilbert Mugodi (48) would threaten to harm the victims saying he was a satanist before sexually abusing them. Mugodi was charged with 11 counts of rape when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Richard Ramaboa. Mr Ramaboa remanded Mugodi in custody to September 6 and advised him to apply for bail at the High Court. On the first count, it is alleged that at around 8pm on March 7 this year, Mugodi was driving a Toyota Raum in Harare when the first complainant boarded the vehicle and sat on the front seat. There were two other passengers in the back seat. The court heard that Mugodi drove to Mbudzi roundabout where the other passengers disembarked. Mugodi told the victim that he was going to pick up another passenger at Boka Tobacco Auction Floors and would drive her to Hopley afterwards. He drove along Harare-Masvingo Road before turning right at Amalinda Road and parked the vehicle in a bushy area. Mugodi allegedly instructed the complainant to suck his genitals but she refused, prompting him to flash her with torch, which produced a weird sound. He claimed he was a ‘satanist.’ The complainant reportedly began to suck his genitals after which he ordered her to remove her underwear and then he raped her. After the sexual attack, Mugodi drove his car to High Glen Road with the headlights off and threatened the complainant that her children would die if she disclosed the incident to anyone. She told a lady pastor who advised her to file a police report which she did at ZRP Glen Norah.
