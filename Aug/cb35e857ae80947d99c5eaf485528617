The Herald NAIROBI. — Freelance journalist, Bonface Osano, says he will instil professionalism in sports management in the country if elected Football Kenya Federation president. The 34-year-old Osano yesterday officially announced his intent to unseat FKF president, Nick Mwendwa. He also unveiled former Harambee Stars midfielder, Innocent Mutiso, as his running mate. “Mwendwa has done a commendable job in the past four years but I believe the time has come to bring significant and positive change in Kenyan football,’’ Osano told a media conference. “And, also to tell you that I am that change.’’ Osano served as assistant secretary at the now defunct football club, Agro Chemicals. Football, even though the most popular sport in the country, has struggled under negative publicity amid reports of poor player welfare, bickering among stakeholders, plus questions over the management of funds and resources. “I had to stop playing when I suffered an injury and my club couldn’t treat me. I will prioritise player welfare because footballers are the most popular stakeholders in the game,’’ said Mutiso. Mutiso turned out for Kenyan Premier League clubs, Mathare United and Gor Mahia, before retiring in 2017. Osano joins other candidates including Mwendwa, Sam Nyamweya, Herbert Mwachiro, Nicholas Musonye, Twaha Mbarak, Lordvick Aduda, Steve Mburu and Dan Mule who have expressed interest in contesting for the presidency during the body’s national elections on October 17. Nyamweya, Musonye, Mbarak, Aduda, and Mburu have since filed a case at the Sports Dispute Tribunal challenging the election rules and register but Mule has accused them of fearing the ballot. “Those disputing the elections have not even made an attempt of getting nominated to contest but instead are complaining loudly even before the contest has began,” said Mule, a former AFC Leopards chairman. — Nation.
