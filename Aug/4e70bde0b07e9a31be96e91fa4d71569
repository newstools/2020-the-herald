The Herald NYON. — FC Copenhagen will face Manchester United in their first European quarter-final after stunning Istanbul Basaksehir 3-0 in the Danish capital last night to overturn a 1-0 first-leg defeat in the UEFA Europa League round of 16. The second leg was just four minutes old when Jonas Wind took flight to dispatch a diving header into the net and level a tie Copenhagen had trailed in for 146 days. The newly-crowned Turkish champions snapped out of their initial torpor but the home side defended resolutely and, with Rasmus Falk pulling the strings, always carried a threat going forward. Wind’s second of the evening — a penalty after Mehmet Topal had been penalised for handball — deflated the visitors but not as much as the killer third as Falk slalomed towards goal before bending in a shot via Mert Günok’s fingertips. Copenhagen will be underdogs again at the UEFA Europa League finals in Germany but the tag certainly didn’t impede them this evening. Meanwhile, Júnior Moraes struck twice either side of a Manor Solomon finish as Shakhtar finished off a listless-looking Wolfsburg side in the UEFA Europa League round of 16 last night. — UEFA.
