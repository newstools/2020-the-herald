The Herald LONDON. — Manchester united are prepared to wait until late in the window before considering a move for Jack Grealish as they push to sign Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund. Grealish, the Aston Villa captain, has long been of interest to United yet it is understood that as things stand, he is not currently a transfer priority at Old Trafford. Any serious offers for Grealish, who has three years remaining on his contract, would likely have to start at least at £80 million. United are keen to strengthen in wide attacking areas and Sancho, who has developed into one of the world’s most valuable forwards during his three seasons in Germany, is their main target, though Dortmund are likely to demand about £110million for the 20-year-old, who has been capped 11 times by England. Dortmund would also like negotiations to be concluded by August 10, which is when they travel to Switzerland for a pre-season training camp. Grealish (24) scored the goal in the 1-1 draw at West Ham on the final day of the season that ensured Villa stayed in the Premier League. Villa’s successful fight against relegation means they are under no financial pressure to sell Grealish, with owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens ready to spend again to make the club more competitive next season. United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has also warned that it is unrealistic to think transfer fees will remain as high as before following the coronavirus pandemic. Grealish has been with Villa throughout his career and shone on his return to the top flight, particularly before lockdown when he scored seven goals and six assists, at times single-handedly keeping Villa alive in the battle for survival. — Mailonline.
