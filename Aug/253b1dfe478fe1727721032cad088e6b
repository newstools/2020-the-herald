The Herald NEW DELHI. — MS Dhoni on Saturday retired from India’s national team ending one of the most heralded international cricket careers ever. Players and fans yesterday urged India’s cricket board to retire Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s number seven jersey in a tribute to the two-time World Cup winning captain. Dhoni called time on his 16-year-old international career on Saturday with a cryptic message on his Instagram post that read “From 1929hrs consider me as retired”. The Board of Control for Cricket in India confirmed the news in a statement, saying: “The boy from Ranchi, who made his ODI debut in 2004, changed the face of Indian cricket with his calm demeanour, sharp understanding of the game and astute leadership qualities.” Dhoni’s legions of fans including 7.8 million Twitter followers and former teammate Dinesh Karthik said they did not want to see No. 7 on the back of any other Indian cricketer’s jersey. There is no provision to retire jerseys in cricket, unlike in football. But the BCCI unofficially retired batting great Sachin Tendulkar’s number 10 shirt a few years after his retirement. — AFP.
