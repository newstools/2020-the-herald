The Herald ZIMBABWEAN apprentice jockey, O’Meara Chiedza Rusike, had her first race since she moved to South Africa to improve her career. Before Sunday’s race, the Zimbabwean had received advice from several top jockeys, including legendary former champion Garth Puller. Her opening SA ride came at Hollywoodbets Scottsville. The 22-year-old, Zimbabwe’s first black female apprentice, rode Magari. “All the girls are at a slight disadvantage,’’ said Puller. ‘’Girls are, obviously, physically less strong than boys. ‘’They often let the horse underneath them get the better of them. “She was a bit unlucky on Sunday. She took a bump and almost came off. She has a good attitude, and work ethic, and has a great chance of going on with it from here.’’ O’Meara has already ridden a winner in Zimbabwe. Orphaned at a young age, her journey to the race track started in 2016 when her adoptive father, Perseverance Ganga, showed her an advertisement in the local rag from December of the previous year. She rode her first race in December 2018. “I am happy that she is now living her dreams,’’ said Ganga. — Sporting Post/Sports Reporter
