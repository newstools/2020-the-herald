The Herald The Scottish Government should order a fleet of electric buses for next year’s UN climate change conference in Glasgow, a report urges. The plan came from the Just Transition Commission which was asked by ministers for advice on implementing a green recovery from the Covid crisis. Its report says a £500m spending commitment to enhance the bus network should be rolled out rapidly. It also calls for a bus scrappage scheme to be developed. This would take older, more polluting buses off the road and allow newer greener alternatives to replace them. The advice has been welcomed by the Falkirk-based bus builder Alexander Dennis which has announced it is to cut hundreds of jobs. Scottish government ministers said the report would be “invaluable” in helping deliver a green recovery. — BBC.
