The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Writer Award-winning soul singer Gemma Griffiths has been appointed brand ambassador for South African- based Zimbabwean insurance company Zororo-Phumulani. The ambassadorial role will last for a year and will be renewed according to the contract. The ‘Titungamire’ hitmaker will be featured in an integrated campaign for the company that will run across television print and online channels to promote the brand. In an interview with The Herald Arts, Gemma said the partnership will go a long way in also developing her musical career. <img class="size-full wp-image-500715" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Gemma.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Gemma.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/Gemma-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Gemma Griffiths and Zororo-Phumulani chief executive and founder Edwin Anderson “I am really happy to join the Zororo-Phumulani powered by Doves Zimbabwe family. To be part of a business that cares for people during their most difficult times, death, has always been my dream. “Thank you Zororo-Phumulani for making this dream come true. I am looking forward to touching a lot of lives through my music and the union with the brand,” she said. Gemma, who is currently in South Africa, has also been writing songs during the lockdown. The lockdown has also given her more time to connect with her fans on social media. Speaking at the signing ceremony that was held at their offices in Durban yesterday, the Zororo-Phumulani founder and chief executive, Edwin Anderson, said his company is pleased to work with the artiste. “Gemma Griffiths fits well into the portfolio of our brand ambassador as she is a symbol of love across the racial and colour divide. “With the help of a renowned singer in Gemma, we hope to increase awareness on the importance of having funeral plans for Zimbabweans who are living in diaspora, especially in the wake of stories that were making headlines recently of dead bodies that are being smuggled into Zimbabwe in haulage trucks,” he said. Meanwhile, the company earlier this year embarked on a mission to raise R1 million to help Zimbabweans who were hit hard by the Covid-19 lock down in South Africa. The company distributed food parcels to hundreds of families who were in dire need of food when South Africa first went in to a national lockdown.
