The Herald LONDON. — Ian Wright has slammed “racially driven” abuse directed towards black football pundits in response to Sky’s decision to sack Matt Le Tissier, Charlie Nicholas and Phil Thompson from Soccer Saturday. The likes of Alex Scott, Micah Richards and Clinton Morrison are among the names tipped to replace them, which split opinion on social media. Responding in a Twitter video, Arsenal legend Wright said: “I’ve had to pull the car over. The racism is going through the roof today. “Somebody answer me this: what does Micah Richards, Alex Scott, Sol Campbell, Clinton Morrison or any other black pundit have to do with Sky’s decision to get rid of these guys, all because three middle-aged white guys have got the sack? “What have these guys done? Because a black person or woman might get the opportunity to do this job? Why are people upset? “Alex Scott, for me, is easily one of the best prepared pundits out there. Easily Micah Richards is the most exciting pundit we’ve seen in years. “Keep their names out of your stinking, unbrushed teeth mouths. Matt Le Tissier, Charlie Nicholas, Phil Thompson, they’ve had an unbelievable run, it’s been a great show. “This happens to everyone in the industry. This is Sky’s decision to evolve the show. And I wish them all the very best. Yes, you can be disappointed that it’s come to an end for those guys, they’ve done brilliantly. “But why does it have to be racially driven? What’s it got to do with Black Lives Matter or the fact that black people may get an opportunity to get those jobs? What?” Le Tissier responded Wright’s video, writing: “Totally agree with you @IanWright0 excellent point well made, racism should be left out of this completely but from one middle aged bloke to another I thought I did a decent job.” Scott also responded, posting four heart emojis. — The Daily Star.
