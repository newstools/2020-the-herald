MASHONALAND Turf Club were yesterday forced to cancel the opening race of the 2020-21 racing season race meeting which was scheduled for Borrowdale Park. MTC chairman, Gary Carter, said they had to pull the plug on today’s scheduled meeting because of a breach of Covid-19 protocols. ‘It is with great disappointment that I have to inform the followers of Borrowdale Park Racing that the meeting scheduled tomorrow (yesterday) is postponed. “On Friday, the MTC were informed by the Sports and Recreation Council of a breach of the Covid-19 protocols that had appeared on social media, and that approval was denied to hold the race meeting on Sunday August 9. “The MTC appealed that decision on the grounds that it was an isolated blemish on an otherwise very successful implementation of the Covid-19 guidelines over the last three months. “At this point in time, the MTC has not received the outcome of that appeal and so has taken the painful decision to postpone the meeting in line with the current ruling. “The MTC will continue to lobby the relevant authorities for a swift return to safe racing and reaffirms its support for the measures taken by the Government of Zimbabwe to fight the spread of this pandemic.”
