In a rare case of domestic violence, a Harare man allegedly hired a “hitman” to kidnap, torture and sexually attack his wife of 14 years at the height of their divorce. The man aged (35) is alleged to have hired Hillary Muvirimi to abduct his wife at home, torture and rape her at a secluded place in Rhodesville, Harare. The name of the wife has been withdrawn for legal reasons. The accused, who was represented by lawyer Mr Obey Shava appeared at the Harare Magistrates’ Courts charged with kidnapping, attempted murder and rape. He was not asked to plead to the charges when he appeared before magistrate Mrs Barbra Mateko, who remanded him in custody to August 18. Mrs Mateko advised him to approach the High Court for bail application. Prosecutor Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti said the couple had been married for 14 years before they separated in 2019 because of irreconcilable marital problems. In July this year, the woman decided to terminate her union. Irked by his wife’s decision, the husband allegedly hired Muvirimi. Allegations are that on July 18, 2020 at around 9pm Muvirimi went to the victim’s place of residence where he picked her on the pretext that he wanted to take her to a client’s place. Armed with a knife, Muvirimi went to park his car along Robert Mugabe Road near Simon Muzenda bus terminus, where he allegedly threatened to stab her. Muvirimi allegedly tied the woman, blind folded her and drove to a secluded place in Rhodesville. It is alleged that he tortured, raped and held her hostage the whole night. Mr Mutsokoti alleged that the accused and Muvirimi were communicating over the phone all the time. The court heard that Muvirimi went on to dump the woman during the wee hours of the following day after taking her belongings worth US$600. Muvirimi was eventually arrested.
