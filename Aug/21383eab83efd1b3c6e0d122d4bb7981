The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE Africa Union Sports Council Region 5 Darts Tournament has been cancelled indefinitely as a way to try and curb the Covid-19 pandemic. National Darts Association of Zimbabwe president, Maynard Moyo, who is also the regional leader, confirmed the cancellation. “Covid-19 has continued to ravage our region, and the whole world at large and, instead of seeing a reduction in the number of infections, it seems the opposite is true,’’ said Moyo. “A quick survey of the region shows that we are recording more infections than before. “We value and put the safety of our members first and, it is against this background that we would like to extend our support, and solidarity, for those who have lost their loved ones because of this pandemic. “We wish a quick, and painless recovery, to all those infected by the virus.’’
