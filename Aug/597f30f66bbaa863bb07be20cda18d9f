ZIMBABWE professional golfer, Greg Bentley, found the going tough in the African Bank Sunshine Tour Championship at Glendower Golf Club in Johannesburg, South Africa, yesterday. Bentley, who made the cut in last week’s Betway Championships, where he pocketed over R6 000, carded a 12-over-par in the two rounds yesterday, to miss the cut. An opening round of 10-over 82 was followed with a two-over-par 74. The South Africa-based professional was the only local player in the second tournament of the Sunshine Tour since golf was given the greenlight to resume. Martin Rohwer is leading the tournament, going into today’s final round. The KwaZulu-Natal professional took the first-round lead, only a few days after finishing seventh in last week’s Betway Championship. He hit a bogey-free round of seven-under-par 65. He started with a birdie on the 10th, his first hole, and ended with three consecutive birdies. Former Zimbabwe Open champion, Lyle Rowe, is his nearest challenger after he shot a 66. Rising star, Jayden Schaper, is in a group of players who opened with rounds of 67. Last week’s winner, Darren Fichardt, is three off the lead, and looking for back-to-back wins on the series.
