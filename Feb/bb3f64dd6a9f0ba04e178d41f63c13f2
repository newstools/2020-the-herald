ZIFA Harare province affiliates will converge at 53 Livingstone Avenue in the capital this morning to set up committees to oversee the launch of the junior development football leagues in the province. The association have invited all affiliated leagues, in the province, from Under-9 to Under-19, for the indaba. NASH and NAPH are also expected to attend the meeting in which the provincial youth development committee will be set up. ZIFA Harare province chairman, Robert Tembo, who is also the association’s youth development committee member, said they were expecting a good turnout. Tembo is one of the country’s most dedicated football administrators. “We will hold a meeting with all our affiliates as we seek to create committees to run leagues which are meant to uplift development and support the ZIFA efforts to nurture up-and-coming footballers,’’ said Tembo. “The youth development committee will oversee the running of the league with localised provincial structures in charge of the day-to-day administration of the leagues. “When the ZIFA board came into office, they emphasised on grooming talent and putting more focus on juniors, as a way of creating a feeder for the national team and a reservoir that national team coaches could tap into. “These leagues are the result of that resolution. Our thrust is on development and this will be only the beginning of big things to come.” The idea of reintroducing junior football leagues is the brainchild of the current ZIFA board, led by Felton Kamambo. ZIFA have announced that junior developmental leagues will be introduced across the country this year. The association will fund the programmes which have so far been successful in Gweru and Bulawayo.
