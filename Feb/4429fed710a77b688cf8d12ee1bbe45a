Five members of the Mangwendere family in the Muzvezve area of Sanyati District were killed by lightning on Monday after they sought shelter under a tree. The victims were Ntombizodwa Muchengeta (44), her daughter Munatsi Mangwendere (20), son Isaac Mangwendere (13), grandson Ishmael (9) and nephew Professor Katsuro (18). Sanyati District Civil Protection Unit chairman, Mr Amigo Mhlanga said the unit would assist with the burial. “They were all killed on the spot, while the other three family members who sought shelter under another tree survived,” said Mr Mhlanga. The district CPU visited Mangwendere Village yesterday. “We visited the homestead to see how best Government can assist given the magnitude of the tragedy,” said Mr Mhlanga. “We will assist with coffins and other logistics.” Barely a week ago, 13 Chitenje Secondary School pupils in Karoi were injured by lightning. Apart from the lightning, floods have claimed two lives in Binga and Rushinga. Speaking during a tour of the affected areas in Binga on Monday, Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Deputy Minister Lovemore Matuke said Government was committed to addressing the challenges being faced by those affected by the natural disasters. He said his ministry would work closely with the Registrar-General’s Department to ensure that affected people get the necessary identification documents in the shortest possible time. “We have visited this area that was hit by floods and we have observed the extensive damage that has happened as a result of the heavy rains,” he said. “Crops were damaged, food stuffs were swept away, some lost their valuable documents such as birth certificates, national identity documents and things like that. Government will assist those who lost documents.” Government gave a 50kg bag of rice and clothes for each of the 181 Binga households.
