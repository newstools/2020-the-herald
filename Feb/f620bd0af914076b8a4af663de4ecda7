VETERAN athlete, Elias Sawari, will headline the inaugural Striders-Exide Zimbabwe half-marathon at Mt Pleasant Sports Club this morning. The 46-year-old, who took part in the Comrades Marathon twice as well as in the Two Oceans Marathon, has confirmed his availability. Sawari, an engineer by profession, is a full marathon specialist. “I have been reducing the distances as I take marathon as a way of keeping myself healthy. “For a healthy life, one needs to train and as a Harare Athletics Club and Striders member, I will continue with the races. “I was preparing for this event, practicing three times a week, and it did not take me to think twice to register for the race. “I expect to do well and beat my last time record,” said Sawari. In the women’s category of the main race, Lucy Maruwa, will also be expected to do well. “I am looking forward to the race and I am grateful to my club Striders and Exide who came together to put the race in place. “My aim is to come out at a respectable position as I know there is a lot of competition out there,” said Maruwa. At least 500 athletes are expected to take part in this morning’s event and Chloride Zimbabwe sales and marketing officer, Pamela Mugara, said all was set for the race. “We are happy to be promoting healthy living through sport and this is only the beginning of big things to come and we are willing to learn since it is the beginning,’’ she said. “We are having a 5km, 10 km and 21km race for both men and women. We are grateful to our partners and we believe this is going to be an annual event on the athletics calendar. “It is part of our social corporate responsibility programme and we believe this is going to be an annual event and will continue to grow with each passing year,” said Mugara.
