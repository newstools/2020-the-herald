RYAN CAIRNS will join three other local professional golfers in today’s Dimension Data Pro-am at Montagu Golf Course in Montagu, South Africa. Cairns booked his place after making the cut for third tournament of 2020 through pre-qualifiers held on Tuesday at the same course. The Royal Harare pro had to battle it out for the cut in a field that had 84 players fighting for 10 clots. His three-under-par 69 saw him finish tied third. Also in the field, through exception, are Mark Williams, Ben Follet-Smith and Marc Cayuex The Zimbabweans, who have struggled in many tournaments, have an opportunity to prove themselves in the R6 300 purse tournament. Last week, the quartet took part in the RAM Cape Town Open at Royal Cape Golf Club where they all struggled. The players failed to record under-par scores and missed the cut. Follet-Smith, who booked his tour card by winning the tournament last year, was a pale shadow of himself as he carded a six over-par 78 in the opening round. This year’s event marks the 25th year of play on the Sunshine Tour (and was co-sanctioned with the European Tour for the first two years).
