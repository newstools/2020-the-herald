The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has made it clear that points tallies and record-breaking win streaks mean very little to the team as they aim for titles. An impressive second half saw his side beat Southampton on Saturday 4-0 to make it 100 points from the last 102 available and 20 successive home league wins with an unbeaten English Premier League football run extending to 395 days. They set another top-flight record by finishing Saturday 22 points ahead of second-placed Manchester City, the biggest gap in history at the end of a day. The only other team to have 20 or more point lead since 1888 was Manchester City (over Manchester United) in May 2018 and it lasted 24 hours and stayed at 19 points for what little remained of the season. Liverpool set their mark on February 1 after racking up 24 wins and one draw in their opening 25 matches and need just seven more wins to guarantee a first domestic championship in 30 years. But facts and figures, records and history, do not matter to Klopp. For him it is only about the next match — which in the league is against Norwich on February 15 as they now go into their maiden mid-season break. “We don’t look at that number, that’s true. The game we lost (prior to the unbeaten) period was at Manchester City,” said the Reds boss, referring to their only Premier League loss (in January 2019) since May 2018. “We could say we lost it because of 11 millimetres (how far goal-line technology ruled Sadio Mane’s shot was from wholly crossing the line) or whatever. “It was a really tight game, so imagine if we would have drawn that day and then I don’t know what the number would be then of how many games we didn’t lose or whatever. “I promise you I don’t lie: we don’t feel it. We just don’t feel it. It doesn’t feel a second like it’s really special, it just feels the hardest work.” — AFP.
