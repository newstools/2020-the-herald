The Herald Sports Reporter DYNAMOS coach Tonderai Ndiraya appears intent on making the most of his time in Belgium where he is on attachment with Belgian top-flight side KV Mechelen. The Warriors assistant coach was pictured in the company of Belgium’s World Cup skipper, Vincent Kompany, who is now back in his homeland after a successful spell in England with Manchester City. While nothing was revealed about their meeting, it’s very likely Ndiraya could have taken the opportunity to get one or two tips from Kompany who is now at Belgian giants Anderlecht. The DeMbare gaffer left for Belgium last week and will be attached to KV Mechelen for 10 days. Dynamos chairman, Isiah Mupfurutsa, said the move was part of a technical co- operation deal structured by the club’s Belgian partners, through consultant Gino Laureyssen, who has long-standing links with Zimbabwean football. “This is part of the technical partnership that we have with our Belgian partners,’’ said Mupfurutsa. “He will observe how Mechelen prepare for their home and away games, what sort of technology and tactics, and all that which they are using there. “As part of the agreement we have with the Belgians, he will be attached to their entire first team technical department (headed by manager Wouter Vrancken) so he will operate just like a part of the club’s technical crew during his attachment.’’ Mupfurutsa said they were hopeful Ndiraya would be a better coach when he returns home on March 2, a few weeks before the start of the 2020 Castle Lager Premiership.
