The Herald DHAKA. — Bangladesh took the plaudits on the second day in Mirpur, with Abu Jayed’s career-best innings haul of 4 for 71 followed up by a maiden Test fifty for Najmul Hossain Shanto. There was also a return to form for Mominul Haque, who registered his first fifty as captain of the Test side. With Jayed’s efforts restricting Zimbabwe’s first innings to 265, partnerships of 78, 76 and 68* from the top order erased much of the deficit as Bangladesh went to stumps on a healthy 240 for 3. Zimbabwe, meanwhile, left the field with a few serious injury concerns. Seamer Victor Nyauchi wore a stinging drive from Tamim Iqbal on his right wrist, and went off for some time to ice the blow. He returned, able to bowl, but when he was struck in the same position while fielding in the covers late in the day, he was once again forced from the field, joining Prince Masvaure on the sidelines. Masvaure himself had to leave and have his right hand strapped in bandages when Mominul thrashed a pull straight at him while he was fielding under the helmet at short leg, the ball cracking into the back of his right hand. It remains to be seen how much of a role either will be able to play in the remainder of the Test. Battered and bruised, Zimbabwe endured a gruelling day in the field as Bangladesh built their innings around a series of steady stands. After the early loss of Saif Hassan, caught behind off Nyauchi, had raised Zimbabwe’s hopes, Shanto settled in alongside Tamim to see the shine off the new ball and take their side out of danger. They burst out of the blocks in the second session, Shanto standing tall to crunch the very first ball after the lunch interval to the cover boundary. He continued to pepper the same region whenever the Zimbabweans obliged him with too much width. Scores Bangladesh 240 for 3 (Mominul 79*, Shanto 71, Tiripano 1-40) trail Zimbabwe 265 (Ervine 107, Nayeem 4-70, Jayed 4-71) by 25 runs — Cricinfo.
