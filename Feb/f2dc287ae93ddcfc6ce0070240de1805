The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Bidvest Wits became the eighth team to qualify for the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals after beating Norman Mapeza’s Chippa United 2-0 on Monday night. Thulani Hlatshwayo and Phathutshedzo Nange scored for the Clever Boys in the first half and the two goals proved enough on the day. Gavin Hunt’s men had a chance to break the deadlock inside the opening 10 minutes but Bienvenu Eva Enga fired wide of the target from inside the small box. The Cameroonian was then forced out with an injury in the 17th minute and his place was taken by Mxolisi Macuphu. Wits then took the lead 10 minutes later as Hlatshwayo broke the deadlock with a deflected header at the near post as Wits went ahead. The Students doubled their lead two minutes later through Nange who fired past Veli Mothwa to make it 2-0. This was Nange’s third goal of the season across all competitions for Wits. Both sides failed to create any clear-cut chances and, at this stage, the Students were in control of the game and brimming with confidence going into the interval. The two teams had a slow start to the second half and coach Norman Mapeza made two changes to try and wrestle the game from Wits by introducing Mduduzi Sibeko and Ruzaigh Gamaldien. However, the changes didn’t have much impact as Wits continued to dominate ball possession. Nange squandered a great chance to complete his brace as he headed a cross from Deon Hotto wide of the target midway through the second half. The final 15 minutes of the games were quiet as Wits were happy to control the game and at time, soak up the pressure from Chippa. Ultimately, the two first half goals were enough to see Wits through to the quarter-finals, joining the likes Mamelodi Sundowns and Bloemfontein Celtic. — Agency.
