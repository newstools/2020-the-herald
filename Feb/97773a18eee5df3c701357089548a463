The Herald Sports Reporter MARLVIN GAKI fired 10-man Chicken Inn to a winning start in their off-season campaign at the Energem International Football Bonanza in Blantyre, Malawi, yesterday. The Gamecocks beat Malawian giants BeForward Wanderers in the opening match of the four-team tournament that also features Mozambican side UD Songo and Malawian champions Nyasa Big Bullets coached by Zimbabwean gaffer Callisto Pasuwa. Dynamos were the team first invited for the tourney but failed to confirm their participation by deadline day. Gaki’s goal, in the first half, gave the Gamecocks maximum points despite Joey Antipas’ side finishing the match with 10 men after striker Obriel Chirinda was shown a red card. But, the win was still sweet music for Antipas, whose side had a bad run at the same tournament last year. Hosts Nyasa Big Bullets were also in action with the Malawian champions managing a 1-0 win over UD Songo courtesy of a 62nd-minute goal from Precious Sambani. The Gamecocks will face Pasuwa’s side Nyasa Big Bullets today at 3pm before wrapping up the tournament tomorrow against UD Songo. All the matches are taking place at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre.
