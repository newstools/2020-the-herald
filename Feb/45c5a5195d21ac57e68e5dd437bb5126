THE ZIFA Northern Region Division One League will hold their annual meeting on February 29 with several issues set to be discussed between clubs and their leaders. The annual meeting will have the region’s affiliates, who include all the 18 Northern Region Division One Soccer League clubs, and their executive, exchanging views on a number of issues. Martin Kweza, the ZIFA Northern Region chairman, said they were expecting a good turnout. ‘’It will be at the meeting that the clubs will know the kick-off dates for the 2020 season as well as their opponents and venues to be used,’’ said Kweza. “We are going to have the important meeting, which will help to shape the direction for us this year. ‘’The good thing is we will also review how last year went and so we expect all the Division One teams, and the affiliates, to attend the AGM. “It is for the clubs’ benefit to be in touch with some of the region’s expectations and it helps for us to kick-off the new season on the same page.” The league will officially welcome the newly-promoted teams — Mashonaland West’s Chinhoyi Stars, Mashonaland Central’s FC Charles and Simba Bhora, Harare Provinces’ Prison FC and Commando Bullets. Most of the teams are said to have already paid commitment fees as guarantees they were financially stable to play in the ZIFA Northern Region League.
