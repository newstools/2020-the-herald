The Herald LAS VEGAS. — Tyson Fury speaking to BT Sport Box Office:
“I told everybody with a pair of ears that the Gypsy King would return to the throne. My last fight everybody wrote me off. I was underweight and over-trained. I’m a destroyer. Not bad for someone with pillow fists. “I’m a man of my word. I told Wilder, his team, the world. We trained for a knock-out; we wasn’t tapping around in that gym. “I talk like this because I can back it up. People write me off, they look at my fat belly and bald head and think I can’t fight. He fought the best Tyson Fury, we’re both in our primes. “I expect him to ask for the third fight. I know he’s a warrior and I’ll be waiting.” Promoter Frank Warren, speaking to the 5 Live Boxing podcast:
“I have been doing this a long time and that was the best performance I have seen from a British boxer in the ring. “I always believed Tyson would stop him and it is the best moment for me, selfishly, but it is also for him and his family. “It is the best comeback in sport, not boxing. He was in the depths of despair and to pull himself back from that is the most amazing thing. It is special.” Deontay Wilder:
“The best man won on the night. My coach threw in the towel but I’m ready to go out on my shield. “I had a lot of things going on coming into this fight but it is what it is. “I just wish my corner would have let me go out on my shield, I’m a warrior. But (Fury) did what he did and there’s no excuses.” Former world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis:
“Congratulations to Tyson Fury on a huge win and bossing his way to the WBC and Ring heavyweight straps. Once again you showed up big. “The best fighters solve puzzles. Tonight Fury solved the puzzle that was Wilder by making him fight going backwards where he’s not as explosive. Big-manned him.” — BBC Sport.
