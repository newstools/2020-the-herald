The Herald LONDON. — Tennis great Roger Federer has undergone surgery to resolve a long-standing knee problem and said yesterday he would be out of action until after the French Open in May. The 20-times grand slam winner revealed on his Facebook account that he underwent surgery in Switzerland on Wednesday and would miss a string of tournaments including the May 24-June 7 French Open. “As a result, I will miss Dubai, India Wells, Bogota, Miami and the French Open,” he said. The 38-year-old explained that he had intended to avoid surgery if possible but the knee problem refused to go away. “My right knee has been bothering me for a little while,” said the world No 3 who reached the Roland Garros semifinals last year. “I hoped it would go away, but after an examination and discussion with my team, I decided to have arthroscopic surgery in Switzerland yesterday.” “After the surgery the doctors confirmed that it was the right thing to have done and are very confident of a full recovery. “I can’t wait to be back playing again soon, see you on grass!” Federer (38) added that doctors were confident he would make a full recovery and he is eyeing a return to the ATP Tour during the grass season. — AFP.
