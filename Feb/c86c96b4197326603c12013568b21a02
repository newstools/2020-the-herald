CRANBORNE Bullets coach, Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera, has predicted an exciting 2020 PSL season as clubs continue to reinforce their squads. His comments came after Dynamos unveiled their 15th signing, Cameroonian Albert Eonde, yesterday. Fellow giants CAPS United have also roped in several new players. “Zimbabwean football is never exciting without Dynamos and CAPS United doing well,’’ said Saruchera. “These two giants, together with Highlanders, have to be performing for Zimbabwean football to thrive.” “If Dynamos, CAPS United and Highlanders are playing good football, and winning games, even Cranborne Bullets football can be competitive. “The ultimate result will be growth, in terms of the league’s value and competitiveness. “So, I would like to bow to CAPS United and Dynamos for the splendid job they have done this pre-season.” “They have tried their level best to sign good players, I should say all the players who have arrived at Dynamos, can actually be turned into national team material if they are willing to work hard. “The same applies to those at CAPS United.’’ Dynamos have pulled all the stops, instructing their security personnel to man all outlets, to deny the media access to their training venue as coach Tonderai Ndiraya toils around in his bid to find rhythm at his Glamour Boys. Cranborne Bullets are scheduled to use Lafarge although the stadium is currently in a dilapidated state. Saruchera said Larfage authorities have agreed to partner with the army side to refurbish the 10 000-seater facility.
