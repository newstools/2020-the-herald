The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — South African Football Association president Danny Jordaan has confirmed that they are working towards implementing VAR in the country. The much-debated technology has seen mixed reaction in the footballing world after it was first written into the laws of the game in 2018 by the International Football Association Board. Since then, 36 domestic leagues across the world, 11 continental competitions and four international tournaments have implemented VAR as well as goal-line technology. However, at present Morocco is the only African country using VAR and goal-line technology. Jordaan, along with SAFA members and 120 referees, gathered at an “important workshop” last week to discuss VAR and the introduction of it into South African football. Also, in attendance was FIFA Head of Referees, Massimo Busacca, and CAF Referees Committee president, Suleiman Hassan Waberi. In a short video released by SAFA, Jordaan explained in detail how long it will take to implement VAR into the country and the necessary complex steps the football association will have to take. — Sport24 .
