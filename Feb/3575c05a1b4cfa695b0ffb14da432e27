The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter AS Mashonaland Turf Club race against time, they will host the first leg of the Triple Crown — the 2020 Zimbabwe Guineas (Gr3) race — at Borrowdale race course on Sunday. The Zimbabwe Guineas is the feature race and will have eight runners in the starting stalls. The MTC are playing catch up after their calendar was hard hit by the rains which recently pounded the capital. Trainer, Bridget Stidolph, will saddle Wantage, Lily Blue and Prescott in a race that has a lot of runners who have potential to cause an upset. There will be a tough contest but the daughter of Black Minnaloushe (US), Lily Blue, looks the one to beat. Kirk Swanson’s trio will have supporters, while the Gokhan Terzi yard is represented by two fairly dark horses — Gladstone, Fire To The Rein and Fire To The Rein. In the race Wantage is given the preference but will need to improve after the filly also had the upper hand in the 1200m Champion Juveniles Stakes but faltered.
