The Herald LONDON. — Paul Pogba has been given the green light to leave Manchester United. And the fed-up Old Trafford hierarchy are now ready to sell him for £150 million. They would have let him go last summer but a fee of £180 million put off Real Madrid and Juventus. Now Pogba (26) and his agent Mino Raiola have been told he can leave at the end of the season as long as their demands are met. Boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the board believe it is best to part ways. Pogba does not believe he can win titles or the Champions League at United during what should be the prime of his career. Agent Raiola has also ruffled Old Trafford feathers with disparaging comments about the club. United now accept the circus surrounding the French World Cup winner  is having a detrimental effect on boss  Solskjaer’s plans going forward — especially as he aims to build a young side  committed to the club. Pogba has made only eight appearances for the club this season due to an ankle injury. When he rejoined United from Juventus in August 2016 he was the then world record £89 million buy. Pogba has since enjoyed glory at Russia 2018 and United want a fee which reflects that. He began his career at United before Sir Alex Ferguson let him go over a contractual dispute. But United bought him back after he helped Juve to four Serie A titles. Pogba’s return, though, has been marred by mixed form and injuries and last summer he expressed a desire for a new challenge. Now he has been told that can happen — if the price is right. — The Sun
