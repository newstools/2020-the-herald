Zimbabwe joins the rest of the world today in celebrating World Radio Day, with the main event set for Gweru where Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa is expected to officiate. This year’s celebrations are running under the theme: “Radio, diversity and development.” Other guests expected to attend the event are Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs Larry Mavima and Deputy Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Dr Energy Mutodi. Many organisations, including Zimpapers, AB Communications and the Zimbabwe Union of Journalists, among others, will give solidarity messages before the main speech by Minister Mutsvangwa. A march by members of the police band and drum majorettes has been lined up as part of the annual celebrations. The day was set aside in 1946 by the United Nations to celebrate how radio shapes peoples’ lives through informing, transforming and uniting. Among other issues, the World Radio Day was proclaimed to raise greater awareness among the public. The world over, radio is a powerful medium for communication used for various purposes such as entertainment and education.
