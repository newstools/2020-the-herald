ZIMBABWE Netball Association president, Leticia Chipandu, says they are being guided by their constitution in terms of when they can have elections for executive posts. ZINA were in November directed to register and recognise the Glow Petroleum-sponsored Rainbow Netball Amateur League and also hold elections by January 31, this year. This followed accusations by the netball stakeholders that the association lacked professionalism and transparency leading to the intervention by the Sports Commission. “On elections, and the Sports Commission’s directive, let me say ZINA is operating with a constitution, and that constitution is registered with the SRC,’’ said Chipandu. “I think it will be better to ask the SRC to look at ZINA constitution, they should be in a position to answer this better because we are behaving according to our constitution.’’ She said their constitution was also registered with the Ministry of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation, through the Sports Commission, and as well the International Netball Federation. The association were governed by a council, she said and, therefore, could not conduct elections without the council’s green-light. “At our normal AGM, together with the council, we will discuss issues that need attention and make appropriate decisions,’’ said Chipandu. “Otherwise, everything that we are doing is according to the constitution,” Chipandu said.
She called for the RANL to follow procedure for them to be fully registered under ZINA. “They are most welcome, we wrote to them, the SRC is aware of that, we said come so that we formalise and we have been waiting for them,’’ she said. “Why wouldn’t we want to give them the Super League, like PSL, or if they want developmental (Division One) why wouldn’t we give them? “Which crazy person would refuse sponsorship, it just has to be procedural that’s all and not just in the newspapers, people who are genuine and professional follow procedure.’’
