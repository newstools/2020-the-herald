The Herald LONDON. — Steven Bergwijn scored a stunning debut goal as Tottenham beat 10-man Manchester City 2-0 and gave Jose Mourinho a long-awaited win over his old adversary Pep Guardiola. Bergwijn controlled the ball with his chest on the edge of the box before volleying the ball home in the same movement to give Spurs the lead on 63 minutes. Son Heung-Min then doubled the home side’s advantage and secured a memorable victory when his 18-yard effort flew past Ederson after taking a deflection off Fernandinho. Almost a late consolation for City as Davinson Sanchez heads against his own crossbar but it’s Tottenham’s day. Jose Mourinho will be thrilled, it’s a landmark win of both his reign and also of the club’s new stadium. They move up to fifth and put another nail in City’s hopes of winning the title. Steven Bergwijn opened the scoring on his debut with a brilliantly taken half-volley, then Son Heung-min doubled the lead, both after Oleksandr Zinchenko had been shown a second yellow card. That came after Ilkay Gundogan saw a penalty saved by Hugo Lloris in a fractious first half. Meanwhile, Burnley wasted the chance to punish Arsenal, who escaped from Turf Moor with a point from a goalless draw. The Clarets at least ended a run that had seen them beaten in their previous 11 games against the Gunners, but the home side should have had more. After riding some early pressure from the visitors, Burnley gradually asserted themselves to bombard the Arsenal goal with headed efforts. Jeff Hendrick and James Tarkowski were most culpable of missing with headers, both failing to hit the target from close range, while Jay Rodriguez volleyed against the underside of the bar when he should have scored. — Mailonline.
