The Herald Moscow. —  The world’s 500 richest people lost a combined $139 billion in one day due to steep declines on  global financial markets caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The development comes as the World Health Organisation said the  infectious disease has the potential to turn into a pandemic and urged  the international community to do more to prepare for such a scenario. The surge of new cases outside China, where the virus originated,  sparked fears among investors that the spread of the disease will weaken  global economic growth. As a result, on Monday the S&P 500 and Dow Jones announced  their sharpest declines in more than two years with the Dow Jones  falling 3,5 percent. Nasdaq closed down 3,7 percent, while Milan’s stock market fell 6 percent on the news that the number of coronavirus cases jumped to 229. — RT.
