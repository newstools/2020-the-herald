The Herald DORTMUND. — Teenage record-breaker Erling Braut Haaland warned Borussia Dortmund still have it all to do to reach the Champions League football quarter-finals even after his two goals sank Neymar’s Paris Saint-Germain. Haaland netted either side of a Neymar equaliser on Tuesday night as the Brazilian superstar scored on his return from injury as the French champions crashed to a 2-1 defeat at Dortmund in the last 16, first leg, tie. “We want to go through, it’s going to be a hard game,” Haaland said of the return leg in Paris on March 11, “but we are a good team. “The result is quite a dangerous one, as Paris has a very strong team and can still go through in the return leg.” Haaland’s team-mate Emre Can, who alongside Axel Witsel worked tirelessly in Dortmund’s midfield to contain Neymar and France striker Kylian Mbappe, said the home side’s defence had been key. “It was a big statement from the team how we defended today. We know it’s not over – it’s just half-time,” said Can, whose permanent transfer from Juventus was confirmed Tuesday. However, the night belonged to Haaland who has 11 goals in his first seven games for Dortmund and warned there is more to come. “I feel like I still can do a lot better,” said Haaland. “I have to work hard to improve to play better at this level.” Having also scored eight goals for Salzburg in the group stages before his €20 million transfer to Dortmund, Haaland made Champions League history on Tuesday. — AFP.
