The Herald NEW YORK. — James Bond is known for his love of fast cars, his most iconic being the  Aston Martin. But it appears Daniel Craig wasn’t allowed to drive the Aston Martin DB5 the whole time he shot his final film as 007, “No time to die”. The actor (51) told Top Gear Magazine on Thursday that he couldn’t drive and act at the same time as it was seen to be too dangerous, so his stunt driver Mark Higgins would take his place while filming high speed chase scenes. Of why this was the case, Daniel explained: “You know we fake it, don’t you? We’re not allowed to do that any more, although I do go driving.” Higgins  spoke with Esquire about getting behind the wheel for Daniel’s final Bond film, and revealed that everything “done is for real”. “I think a lot of these films are going away from CGI and trying to make it as real as possible,” Higgins explained. “The environment we were driving in was restricted and  very tight. So it’s a difficult place to work in.” He went on to add that while Daniel ‘‘enjoys driving when he can’’, he was also happy to take a step back and let the professionals do the work. “He’s a fantastic actor, so thankfully he lets me do the driving and I let him do the acting so we’ve got a bit of a deal,” Higgins joked. Despite the precautions, Daniel’s time on set wasn’t without pain as he suffered a nasty ankle injury while filming a separate chase sequence in Jamaica, the spiritual home of Bond creator Ian Fleming. The actor, underwent an operation followed by two weeks of rehabilitation in May, causing major delays to the long awaited production. The official Twitter account for Bond 25, released a statement concerning his injuries at the time, writing: “Daniel Craig will be undergoing minor ankle surgery resulting from an injury sustained during filming in Jamaica. “Production will continue while Craig is rehabilitating for two weeks post-surgery. “The film remains on track for the same release date in April 2020.” — www.dailymail.co.uk
