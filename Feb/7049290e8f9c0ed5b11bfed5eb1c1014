The Herald LONDON. — Pep Guardiola has told Manchester City players he is committed to the English Premiership football club, saying: “Even if they put us in League Two, I will still be here.” Raheem Sterling is also committed to City despite UEFA handing the club a two-year suspension from European competition for Financial Fair Play rule breaches, a ruling the club are appealing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. UEFA say City “overstated its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to UEFA between 2012 and 2016”. European football’s governing body also say City were guilty of “failing to cooperate in the investigation by the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB)”. City responded by saying they were “disappointed but not surprised” and described the process as “prejudicial”. They have also stated their intention to appeal the punishment with the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Since Friday’s ruling, there has been speculation Guardiola could choose to walk away from City. However, the Catalan has told City players: “Look, whatever league we are in, I will still be here. “Even if they put us in League Two, I will still be here. This is a time for sticking together.” Guardiola’s deal expires at the end of the 2020/21 season and he has no intention of cutting it short. The 49-year-old has never broken a contract as a manager. Unless City overturn the ban imposed by Uefa on Friday, they will not compete in European football until 2022 after this season. Guardiola’s contract is due to expire in 2021. He is expected to speak about the subject for the first time tomorrow. — Sky Sports.
