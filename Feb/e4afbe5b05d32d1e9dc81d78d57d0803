The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool can make English Premier League football history at Watford today as the runaway leaders aim to move within three wins of clinching the title. While Jurgen Klopp’s side are racing towards the title, the battle to qualify for the Champions League and the struggle to avoid relegation look set to go down to the wire Chelsea, Manchester United, Tottenham and Wolves can all bolster their European hopes this weekend, with West Ham, Norwich, Bournemouth and Watford among those scrapping for survival. Liverpool’s historic charge towards a first English title since 1990 will reach another landmark moment if they beat Watford. The Reds equalled Manchester City’s English top-flight record of 18 consecutive league wins, set between August and December 2017, when they fought back from 2-1 down to beat West Ham 3-2 on Monday. Klopp’s men, who need four victories from their final 11 games to guarantee the title, can break City’s record with win number 19 at Vicarage Road. With second-placed Manchester City on League Cup final duty against Aston Villa tomorrow, a victory against the struggling Hornets would put Liverpool 25 points clear at the top. If they do win their next four games, they will lock up the title with seven matches to spare, beating the Premier League record of five, which is currently shared by Manchester City in 2017-18 and Manchester United in 2000-01.
