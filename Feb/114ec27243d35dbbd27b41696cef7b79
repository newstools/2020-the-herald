He said youths were the life blood of the party. “Their energy, zeal and enthusiasm are the dynamic that separates Zanu PF from other pseudo political parties in Zimbabwe,” said Cde Chinamasa. “Zanu PF welcomes the positive and constructive contributions of the youth towards the strengthening of the party, as well as their catalytic posture in national development.” In line with President Mnangagwa vision 2030 clarion call to the nation at large, Cde Chinamasa said the youth had a vital role to play in the economic, technological, social and political trajectory that will see Zimbabwe ascending to upper middle income status.
