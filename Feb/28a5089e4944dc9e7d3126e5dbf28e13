The Herald Davison Bhunu Sports reporter EDWARD Muthibi, the winner of last year’s Comrades Marathon in South Africa, is set to be the major attraction at this year’s CBZ Peter Gradwell Marathon on March 8 at Old Georgians Sports Club in Harare. CBZ Holdings group executive, marketing and corporate affairs manager, Matilda Nyathi, revealed yesterday they have invited Muthibi to add an international flavour to this year’s event. Last year’s event attracted more than 1 000 athletes. The event is also used as pre-qualifier for both the Two Oceans Marathon and the Comrades Marathon. The marathon, which has become an annual event on the local road running calendar, will see participants drawn from men’s and women’s Open categories, senior, veterans — both men and women — competing in four distances — the 42,2km, 21,1km, 10km, 5km and wheelchair racing. “The main objective of the marathon is to encourage, inspire and motivate people of all ages and backgrounds to improve their mental and physical health through running and exercising. “It will also be our second edition of the Peter Gradwell Marathon and our local athletes and fitness enthusiasts’ will also be joined in the race by last year’s Comrades Marathon winner Edward Muthibi,” said Nyathi. Last year’s CBZ Peter Gradwell Marathon was won by Munyaradzi Jari who crossed the finishing line in 2 hours 23 minutes 6 seconds. Jari also represented Zimbabwe at the 2019 World Athletics Champions in Dubai last year. Olivia Chitate was the winner in the women’s field.
