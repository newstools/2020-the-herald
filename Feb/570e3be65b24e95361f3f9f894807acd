HE has achieved a lot as a top-notch karateka and is an inspiration to the young generation who want to follow in his footsteps. Zimbabwe’s martial arts story is never complete without the mention of Samson Muripo. And, for that, the Zimbabwe So-kyokushin Karate-Do Organisation have decided to hold a tournament, the Samson Muripo Challenge Cup on February 21. It’s meant to celebrate and to acknowledge the veteran fighter’s accomplishments. The tournament is scheduled for the Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex where So-kyokushin fighters will battle it out in a unique meet, which will also see fighters from other styles squaring off. So-kyokushin Karate-Do Organisation technical director, Kumbirai Musinami, said they want to celebrate with Muripo. “The Samson Muripo Cup Challenge is being organised by So-kyokushin Karate-Do Organisation,’’ he said. “It’s our tournament, it’s our own initiative. “The reason behind is to honour Shihan Muripo for his success and achievements in karate. “We need to honour him while he is still alive, celebrate together with him given what he has achieved and what he has accomplished. “We are taking the opportunity to prepare our athletes for upcoming regional and international tournaments. “All fighters that are going to be fighting in the regional, as well as international events, are going to participate in this tournament and we will see how much progress they have made.’’ Muripo became a household name in 2009 when he became the first African world champion in 2009. He won the middle weight division at the Kyokushin World Cup in Japan. He repeated the same feat last year, at the same tournament, but this time coming tops in the Veterans Open category. Muripo is currently preparing for the Second So-kyokushin World tournament in April, in Japan.
