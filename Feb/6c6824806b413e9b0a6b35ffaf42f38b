AFTER a two-month hiatus from racing, the country’s top junior and senior motocross will be back in action tomorrow at Donnybrook Park Raceway. They will be competing in the opening round of the 2020 Bogwheelers Club National Championship series. This year will once again see the Bogwheelers Club, who run the motorcycling sport of motocross in this country, hosting six National Championship events. The first one is set for tomorrow while the other five will be staged on March 15, June 28, July 12, October 4 and November 22, all at Donnybrook. Some of the country’s top junior and senior male and female motocross riders will tomorrow converge at Donnybrook for the opening round of this year’s National Championship series. It comes after they last competed competitively in the Zimbabwe Summer Series which was held during the second week of December last year. Tomorrow’s event will be held under the stewardship of Phil dos Santos who recently took over as the chairman of the Bogwheelers Club. Last Sunday saw a number of the country’s top junior and senior riders having a “shake down” during the 2019 prize-giving function at Donnybrook where those who excelled last year were rewarded for coming out tops in the different classes that they competed in during both the National Championship series and Club events. Unfortunately, Emmanuel Bako, who was crowned the 2019 85cc Class Club Champion during last Sunday’s prize-giving function at Donnybrook, will not be available for tomorrow’s event. He is scheduled to compete in a pre-National Championship race meeting in South Africa. The opening round of the 2020 South African National Championship will be held on February 15 at Rover in Port Elizabeth where Bako will compete in the 85cc (big wheel) Class and 125cc Class; and the 13-year-old rider is this weekend back in South Africa to race in a pre-National Championship event at the same venue. “We would have loved Emmanuel to compete in the opening round of the local National Championship series at Donnybrook on Sunday (tomorrow) but unfortunately there’s a pre-National Championship event at Rover in Port Elizabeth on Saturday (today) and he has to compete there,” said Bako’s father and manager, Brighton. But five-year-old, Victor Nyamupfukudza, who has this year graduated to ride in the 50cc Class after having been crowned the 2019 PeeWee Class Champion could be the one to watch. The PeeWee Class is designed for riders under the age of seven but Nyamupfukudza’s father and trainer, Simbarashe, yesterday told The Herald that he has decided to move his son into the 50cc Class this year. 2020 Motocross Calendar DATE                  EVENT 25.01.2020 — FLAT TRACK/OVAL 02.02.2020 — MOTOCROSS – NATIONAL 15.02.2020 — FLAT TRACK/OVAL 07.03.2020 — FLAT TRACK/OVAL 15.03.2020 — MOTOCROSS – NATIONAL 22.03.2020 — FLAT TRACK/OVAL 05.04.2020 — MOTOCROSS – RESTRICTED 25.04.2020 — ENDURO 10.05.2020 — MOTOCROSS – RESTRICTED 06.06.2020 — FLAT TRACK/OVAL 20.06.2020 — FLAT TRACK/OVAL 28.06.2020 — MOTOCROSS – NATIONAL 12.07.2020 — MOTOCROSS – NATIONAL 26.07.2020 — MOTOCROSS – RESTRICTED 07 – 09.08.2020 — MXoAN – UGANDA 16.08.2020 — MOTOCROSS – RESTRICTED 12.09.2020 — FLAT TRACK/OVAL 27.09.2020 — MOTOCROSS – RESTRICTED 04.10.2020 — MOTOCROSS – NATIONAL 24.10.2020 — FLAT TRACK/OVAL 07.11.2020 — ENDURO – ARCADIA 22.11.2020 — MOTOCROSS – NATIONAL 28.11.2020 — FLAT TRACK/OVAL 09.11.2020 — SUMMER SERIES – SUPERCROSS 11.12.2020 —  SUMMER SERIES – SUPERCROSS 13.12.2020 — SUMMER SERIES – MOTOCROSS
