The Herald Joseph Madzimure Senior Reporter THE Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (Zimsec) has heeded the Government’s directive to reduce examination fees to $15. Zimsec had increased exam fees to $190 per subject from $15 for Ordinary Level candidates and $351 per subject from $26 for Advanced Level candidates. The Government ordered the examinations council to revert to the fees structure approved in 2015. Zimsec public relations manager Ms Nicky Dlamini said they have heeded the Government directive and said all schools should adhere to the new thrust. “The examination fees still stand at $15. We have not sent a circular to schools informing them of any changes on examination fees. ‘‘If any school is found on the wrong side of the law, the parents should report directly to the relevant ministry so that drastic measures will be taken accordingly. “We are guided by the Government on the examination fees structure. What the Government said will remain. “If there are any changes, we will send a circular to schools informing them,” she said. Yesterday, some mischievous social media users generated messages claiming that Zimsec had stuck to the examination fees structure it had announced earlier. Rumours said some schools had advised students during yesterday’s assembly that the exam fees had not gone down, prompting parents to panic. The Herald was inundated with calls from concerned parents who sought to establish the truth. The closing date for payments and submission of entries for June examinations is February 28, while the closing date for November examinations is March 27. Late entries will close on May 15.
