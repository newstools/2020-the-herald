Organisers of the 19th National Arts and Merit Awards (NAMA) have said that they have divided their awards show into three categories.
These are the red carpet event, awards pre-show and the main awards ceremony and all is open to the public. This year’s event will be held at a local hotel and will run under the theme ‘Taking Back to the People’ Addressing a press conference at their offices in Belgravia, Harare, Nama executive producer Napoleon Nyanhi said they divided the event to ensure a smooth flow and a great production. “The awards will focus much on the glitz and glamour part hence we have a 30-metre long red carpet and the event on the red carpet will run for one hour and 30 minutes with four presenters, then a pre-show where a number of performers are billed to perform then the main show. We are keeping our host a surprise so as to keep our fans in suspense,” he said.
