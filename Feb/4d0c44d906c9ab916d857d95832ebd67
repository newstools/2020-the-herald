The Herald LONDON. — Arsene Wenger has backed Liverpool to beat the record run of unbeaten games in the English Premier League football, set by his Arsenal team, and go the whole season without a loss. The Reds are 22 points clear at the top of the table and already have the title wrapped up, barring a monumental collapse. Jurgen Klopp’s side have won 25 and drawn one of their games so far and have extended their unbeaten run in the English Premier League to 43 matches, stretching back to last January. Wenger’s team went undefeated in the league in 2003/04 and enjoyed a run of 49 matches without a loss which ran into the following season, setting a record in the English Premier League. The Frenchman knows there is a lot of work ahead of Klopp and his men, but sees no reason why they cannot top that 49-match mark and remain undefeated till the end of the season. “They are doing exceptionally well,” Wenger told Sporf. “They put a team together that is very efficient, very consistent and has good fighting qualities as well, so let’s see. “The records are there to be beaten and they can do it.” Asked whether he would be sad to see Klopp take his record, Wenger replied: “He has to fight for himself and I would completely understand that.” — Metro.
