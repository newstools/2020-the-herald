The Herald PRESIDENT Mnangagwa revealed he supports FC Platinum and English Premiership giants Chelsea. The President is the patron of FC Platinum, his hometown side, which made history when they became the first club from outside Harare and Bulawayo to be crowned league champions in 51 years. President Mnangagwa revealed the two football clubs he supports while talking to the Russian media in January 2018. Europe’s biggest country was preparing to host the FIFA World Cup finals for the first time that year. “At home I support FC Platinum. I also support the team which (Didier) Drogba used to play for . . . Chelsea,” the President said. FC Platinum have been undergoing a revolution since their arrival in the domestic Premiership in 2011. They became the first club from outside Harare and Bulawayo to win the league championship in Independent Zimbabwe. The Zvishavane side have now won the last three domestic Premiership titles.
