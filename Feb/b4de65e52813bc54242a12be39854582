ZIMBABWE’S tennis ace, Benjamin Lock, got off to a winning start at the Morelos Open in Mexico on Monday. He defeated Argentine Agustin Velloti in a singles match. Lock romped to a 6-3, 6-2 victory in his first match to progress to the second round where he was set to face Ecuadorian, Roberto Quiroz Gómez, late yesterday. The Zimbabwean was also in action on Tuesday when he teamed up with his Spanish partner, Adrian Menendez Maceiras, for another sweet victory. They beat the Austrian duo of Sabastian Ofner and Jurij Rodionov 4-6, 6-3 (10-8) to qualify for the quarter-finals in the men’s doubles competition. Lock should be oozing with confidence as he arrived in Mexico on the back of probably the biggest win of his professional career. He was in the company of American, Evan King, as they won the men’s doubles title at the Launceston International in Australia earlier this month. Another Lock sibling, Courtney, is also in Mexico for the Morelos Open. He was set to feature in a doubles match late yesterday. The Lock brothers are key members of the Zimbabwe’s Davis Cup team together with Takanyi Garanganga and Mehluli Sibanda. Zimbabwe have a date against Syria next month and Benjamin Lock’s winning form could come in handy ahead of the Davis Cup World Group II play-offs first round match. It’s set for March 6-7 at Harare Sports Club.
