THE Sports Commission are yet to act on the concerns raised by some stakeholders in the Zimbabwe Aquatic Union over the way the organisation is being run. The stakeholders, who aired their grievances last year, said they were still to get feedback from the Sports Commission, five months after their submissions. A concerned stakeholder, who preferred anonymity, said they were now worried their concerns will never be addressed. They claim some influential individuals within the Sports Commission are working with the ZAU leaders to frustrate them. “We aired our concerns with the Sports Commission last year and up until now nothing has been done,’’ the stakeholder said. “As parents, we cannot have the sport being run like that and most of us now fear that this is a protected sport. “We wrote to them as we feel the leaders are prejudicing athletes, administrators and coaches with some of their boardroom moves. “Things, such as ignoring what the constitution say, unilateral changes to the rules to make them better deal with people who question how they work, dishonesty when it comes to returns submitted to the SRC, selection of swimmers for tours, are what concerns us.’’ Sports Commission corporate communications officer, Tirivashe Nheweyembwa, last year confirmed receiving the letter but referred responses to the director general, Prince Mupazviriho who, in turn, said he never handled such an issue.
