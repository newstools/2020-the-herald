She revealed this during an interview with The Herald on the side-lines of a three-day workshop on asset recovery currently underway in Harare. The workshop is sponsored by the World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Justice Matanda-Moyo said they will soon initiate the process of repatriating the monies back once the paper work is in order. “Informally, we have now identified US$7 billion cash and property all over the world which were siphoned by our former and current leaders including private individuals. We got this information informally. So, now we have to formalise the process so that we start the processes of repatriating the monies back home. <img class="size-full wp-image-475310" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/WhatsApp-Image-2020-02-25-at-12.36.48.jpeg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/WhatsApp-Image-2020-02-25-at-12.36.48.jpeg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/02/WhatsApp-Image-2020-02-25-at-12.36.48-360x200.jpeg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Workshop facilitator Mr Jonathan Benton “The purpose of this training is to equip our officers in the techniques of repatriation of stolen funds back home.
