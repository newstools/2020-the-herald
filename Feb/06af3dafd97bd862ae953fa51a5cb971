The Herald Davison Bhunu Sports Reporter PRINCE Edward are set to feature in this year’s edition of the St Stithians Schools Rugby Festival scheduled for April 9-13 in South Africa. The Tigers will be competing in the tourney for a second straight year in the rugby gala after having missed it for 23 years. Bishops, Grey PE, Jim Fouché, King David Linksfield, Kingswood, Maritzburg College, Michael house, Northcliff, SACS, St Andrew’s of Graham’s Town and hosts, St Stithians, are expected to feature in the tournament. The St Stithians rugby festival started in 1984 and is the oldest and largest Easter Rugby Festival for schools. Top schools in South Africa, and from across the world, grace the tourney every year. The tournament will get underway on April 9 with Saints Stithians taking on Prince Edward. The tournament has also been used, as a scouting platform, by some clubs. Thabani Maguranyanga, the son of former Warriors’ fitness trainer Gerald, Tinashe Mhere and Tanaka Gumbo secured scholarships after impressing at the tournament. “There will be scouts at the tournament and if our boys play well they can get the recognition they need and, maybe, their fortunes around,’’ said Prince Edward sporting director, Tawanda Jimu.
