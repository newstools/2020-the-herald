ZIFA successfully launched its junior development leagues in the capital where a provincial youth development committee was set up to administer the leagues on Friday. The league will have 10 junior boys and girls Under-15 leagues which should start next month. ZIFA youth development committee member, and Harare Province vice-chairman Olivarth Guviriro, said the leagues were meant to boost development efforts countrywide to nurture up-and-coming footballers. “When the ZIFA board came into office they emphasised on grooming talent and putting more focus on juniors as a way of creating a feeder for the national teams and reservoir that national team coaches can tap into,’’ said Guviriro. “These leagues are the result of that resolution. “While we are starting with the Under-15 age group, in the coming year, we will also have other age groups such as the Under-17s.” He said the national launch will be held on March 14 in Mutare after which provincial leagues will start. To ensure effective development of emerging talent, only ZIFA-licensed coaches, who hold CAF C or Level Two badges, will be allowed to take charge of the teams. The leagues are open to any interested clubs, and schools, and will cater for both boys and girls. Harare province chairman, Robert Tembo, said the initiative was good as it will help create a database for all players.
