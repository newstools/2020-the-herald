ZIMBABWE’S tennis ace, Benjamin Lock, crashed out of the singles competition at the Morelos Open in Mexico when he lost to Roberto Quiroz Gómez on Wednesday. Lock fell 2-6, 7-5, 6-1 to the Ecuadorian in the second round. The defeat means he will now focus in the men’s doubles where he has already qualified for the quarter-finals with his Spanish partner, Adrian Menendez Maceiras. Lock’s brother, Courtney, was also in action when he played his debut match of the tournament in the doubles alongside American player, Evan King. However, the duo was defeated 4-6, 4-6 by Venezuelan, Luis David Martinez, and his Mexican partner, Miguel Angel Reyes-Verela. Courtney’s loss leaves his brother Benjamin as the only Zimbabwean representative in the competition.
