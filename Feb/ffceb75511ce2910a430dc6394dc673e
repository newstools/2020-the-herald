The Herald Davison Bhunu Sports Reporter TRIANGLE coach Taurai Mangwiro has named Collins Dhuwa as the new captain following a player exodus that saw them lose their inspirational leader, Richard Kawondera. Dhuwa will be assisted by Brian Chikwenya with veteran goalkeeper Ronald Mudimu as the second vice-captain. “We lost quite a number of players in this transfer season, including the two team captains Ralph Kawondera and Kudzai Chigwida, but we have since added a number of players to beef up the squad,’’ said Mangwiro. “So far, things are looking good for us, l would not point to it as a crisis, we should be good to go to launch a formidable challenge. ‘’No one would love to lose players but once they are gone you cannot continue to cry over spilt milk. “It’s important to embrace those who have joined us. l hope and believe that our new players will deliver for us.’’ The Sugar Sugar Boys signed veteran striker Ralph Matema, James Mukombwe, Shepherd Gadzikwa and goalkeeper Takabva Mawaya from ZPC Kariba. The club are also yet to confirm the signing of Talbert Shumba from Chapungu with the deal to rope in the veteran shot-stopper in the final stages.
