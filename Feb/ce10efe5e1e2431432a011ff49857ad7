ZIMBABWE women’s Under-20 national football team captain Cynthia Shonga says they are hopeful of a positive result this afternoon against Malawi. The two teams clash in the preliminary round second leg tie of the Fifa Under-20 Women’s World Cup qualifier at Barboufields. The Young Mighty Warriors held Malawi to a 1-1 draw in the opening encounter two weeks ago. The Under-20 side, under the guidance of Rosemary Mugadza, continued with their camp on their return from Malawi. “We are looking forward to victory tomorrow (today). We cannot say much right now, but we just want to win the game tomorrow,’’ said Shonga. “We have been working as a team, and when we came back from Malawi, we didn’t break camp, we continued training and that gave us more time to build the team. “The presence of supporters also boosts the confidence. When we played in Malawi, their fans were rallying behind them. So, we are urging the supporters to come.’’ Young Mighty Warriors Final 18 Goalkeepers: Cynthia Shonga, Tariro Chirume Defenders: Pationa Nyamugure, Precious Baison, Moreblessing Bwende, Sharon Teterai, Faith Chezhara, Ennerty Chemhere, Annie Ndura Midfielders: Valeria Packry, Talent Bizeki, Dinah Rose Banda, Tinotenda Sakara Strikers: Shyline Dambamuromo, Rennie Mudimu, Beata Chako, Nothando Mthunzi, Greatwin Dzawo.
