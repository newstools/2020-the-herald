The Herald HIS small stature betrays a lot, opponents included but, as they say, dynamite comes in small packages. Diminutive Raphael “Fiji” Muduviwa is the last man standing and the longest serving player at FC Platinum. Alongside goalkeeper, Francis Tizayi, he joined the club in 2012. As the champions celebrate 25 years, Muduviwa has opened up on the team’s long kept secret. Brutal honesty, albeit constructive, is the glue that has kept FC Platinum together and powered the club to success. Muduviwa has revealed that, at FC Platinum, players are an authentic lot and are bold and honest with each other at training, during and after the match. “We came here to work and we have families to feed. The objective is one and the shared vision is what keeps the team focused,” he said. Not everything is perfect, however, and Fiji says the family atmosphere, within the club, allows the players to speak freely to one another when the need arises. “We have played together for a good three to five years, so we know each other at a more intimate level. “Even our kids and spouses interact more frequently. We are one big family.” The intimacy, Muduviwa reckons, is what has allowed the players to be honest with each other. “Sometimes, we have to be honest with each other and say things that someone outside our circle may not be free to say. “But, that helps us also to be a better team because we all demand 100 percent effort from each other,” he said. Looking ahead, Muduviwa says he is keen on winning his fourth league title and has assured the Pure Platinum Family that he will score his first goal for the club in 2020. On the CAF Champions League Muduviwa, believes the experience gained over the past years has been an asset for the club. “Every situation is different but I’m confident that the team will do well this time around,” he said.
