The Herald An owner of eight Spar grocery stores has been ordered to pay over R11 million to staff for not complying with labour laws. The Department of Employment and Labour on Monday issued a statement indicating that the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration had granted it eight arbitration awards — against the owner, cited only as a “Mr Giannacoupolous” in the department’s statement. The CCMA’s decision comes following inspections at outlets conducted in May 2019 by the department, this after it had received a “series of complaints of alleged gross violations of labour laws”. The Spar stores inspected were the Spar Orchards, Dely Road, Doornport Spar, Montana Spar, Wierda Spar, Silverton Spar, Zambezi Super Spar, Rietfontein Spar, Silverplace Spar and Safari Spar in Rustenburg. Collectively, the stores employ 565 workers. — News24.
