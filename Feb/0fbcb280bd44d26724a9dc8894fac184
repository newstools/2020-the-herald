Isaac Muguti, the guarantor of music promoter Partson Chimbodza, filed the lawsuit in the High Court. Muguti, through his company Metro Systems, brokered a deal under which Chipaz Promotions would sell Chimbodza’s instruments under a hire purchase agreement.

Muguti decided to approach the High Court seeking to recover the money owed to him. Muguti’s application indicates that Metro Systems is contemplating instituting legal proceedings against Chimbodza. “It is inequitable that one person should be enriched to the detriment and injury of another,” read the papers.
