Prince Edward have won the Peterhouse Songore tournament, the Petra tournament and the St John’s festival. Churchill coach, Tawanda Chitsindi, said they were confident of victory. ‘’It’s going to be tough but I know my players have the character and enjoy playing away,’’ he said. ‘’We have good players who are capable of winning matches and we will bank on point guard Tafadzwa Gororo, Tinashe Dyakonda and Regis Chidzomba. “We have been working hard and the boys are raring to go.’’
