The Herald Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni was set to lead a South African government delegation to an investment summit in the United Kingdom yesterday in a bid to bolster trade and investment between the two countries. According to National Treasury, Mboweni and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Naledi Pandor will represent South Africa as they attend the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London. The summit is taking place ahead of the start of the annual World Economic Forum, which kicks off today in Davos, Switzerland.
Treasury said the ministers will be on the charm offensive at both events. “Team South Africa will communicate at both the UK-Africa Investment Summit and WEF platforms, the message that while South Africa faces challenges of weak economic growth and fiscal pressures, the country remains open for business as one of the best investment destinations in the world”. The summit focuses on sustainable finance, trade and investment, future African growth sectors, and clean energy and climate. — Reuters.
