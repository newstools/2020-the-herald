The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo,Senior Arts Reporter Sungura ace Nicholas “Madzibaba” Zakaria has described 2019 as having been a good year and dismissed as false social media reports that he was retiring from music. The 64-year-old musician said he will be back in the studio in May to record another album, which has become his tradition to release something every year. Last year, he released “Inzwa Unzwe” which was well-received, although it was affected by piracy. “It’s too early to quit music though I am getting old. I have heard the rumours and people ask me why I intend to retire from music in 2020. “I don’t know where they are getting the information from. People are being misled. I only said in 2020, I will fulfil my promise of building a music academy in Chitungwiza. It is long overdue after getting the land from Chitungwiza City Council,” said Zakaria. “Not many people know that I was appointed cultural ambassador for Chitungwiza town.” Zakaria said in December he staged two shows in Mutare and Kadoma, proving that he was still in the game. The “Tsamba” hitmaker said he was planning to do regional collaborations this                                                                                            year. “I had major collaborations with upcoming and renowned musicians in 2019. It was a good year considering that I also gave an opportunity to upcoming musicians who featured on my album. “In 2020, I will continue to do collaborations with the younger generation and I am also working with two musicians in South Africa,” he said. “Music in Zimbabwe has diversified and there is need to accept and appreciate new artistes,’’ he added. “Things will not always be the same but they change hence we need to move with time. Who knew I would do a collaboration with Shugeta?” he said.
