The Herald LOS ANGELES. — Tiger Woods is relishing the chance to return to a familiar hunting ground as he gets his 2020 golf season schedule underway at the Farmers Insurance Open in California. Woods makes his first appearance since winning all three matches as a player-captain in Team USA’s Presidents Cup victory at Royal Melbourne in December, having won the Zozo Championship in his previous PGA Tour start. The world No. 6 is a seven-time winner of the Torrey Pines event, where he also won the US Open in 2008, with Woods looking to build on that record as he challenges for a history-making 83rd PGA Tour title. “I’ve always have enjoyed coming down here to Torrey Pines,” Woods said. “It’s been near and dear to my heart for a number of years and I’m looking forward to getting out there and playing. “I feel like I ended the year (2019) on a good note, and I felt like my game really didn’t need a whole lot of dusting off. I didn’t touch a club until my birthday (December 30). “That was the only day I touched a club since the Presidents Cup. Just wanted to get away from it, I was a little bit fried physically, mentally, emotionally and just wanted to have it all end.” Woods plays alongside Collin Morikawa and Jon Rahm for the first two rounds, played across two courses, with Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose among the other names in a start-studded field. The former world No. 1 has been experimenting with new clubs in the off-season, although is still undecided as to whether they will be in the bag once the tournament gets underway on Thursday. — Sky                                         Sports.
