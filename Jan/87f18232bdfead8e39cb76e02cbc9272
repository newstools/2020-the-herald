The Herald NAIROBI. – Desert locusts that have ravaged north-eastern Kenya have made their way to Meru and Isiolo counties even as government officials downplayed their threat. On Tuesday evening, residents of Ndumuru in Igembe North reported spotting several colonies of the destructive pests. More swarms of the locusts have also invaded neighbouring Garbatulla and Merti areas in Isiolo County. Ndumuru Chief Romano Muchiri said the locusts, which are in nymph (wingless) stage, have been spotted in several groups feeding on shrubs. Igembe North Deputy County Commissioner Charles Langat said government officials were monitoring the situation, adding that there was no cause for alarm. “The locusts have been spotted but their population is not big. They are currently feeding on euphobia trees. We will ensure that they are contained before they pose a threat to vegetation in the area,” Mr Langat  said. “The situation is not very bad but the crop protection desk will be giving priority to Meru because their spread will be disastrous. My officers are monitoring the situation and the regional locust control body is helping,” Ms Mutiga said. The invasion of locusts comes five days after Meru Jubilee Party chairman Joseph Muturia warned that the pests would soon reach the county from Wajir if not contained on time. Mr Muturia called on the government to pump in more resources into fighting the locusts that have ravaged the north-eastern region to avert famine. Mr Muturia, who says he witnessed a locust invasion in Meru in 1948, accused the government of knee-jerk reactions to disasters. He called on the government to work closely with the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) Desert Locust Control Committee to ensure the situation is contained. – Daily Nation (Kenya)
