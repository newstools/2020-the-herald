The Herald ROME. — Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice as Juventus beat Parma 2-1 to pull four points clear of Inter Milan at the top of the Italian Serie A football table on Sunday. Inter’s title push hit another stumbling block after a 1-1 draw at lowly Lecce while Ante Rebic fired city rivals AC Milan to a last gasp 3-2 win over Udinese. Ronaldo broke through just before the break, to score in a seventh consecutive league game, and almost set up a second just after for Aaron Ramsey, but the Welsh international rattled the post. Andreas Cornelius scored with a towering header to get seventh-placed Parma back level ten minutes after the break.
But the visitors hardly had time to celebrate when Ronaldo broke through again after latching onto a Paulo Dybala cross for his 11th goal in seven games to bring his league tally this season to 16. The eight-time reigning champions have a four-point cushion on Inter, who have won only two of their last six league games. — AFP.
