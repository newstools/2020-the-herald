The Herald Joseph Madzimure Senior Reporter President Emmerson Mnangagwa yesterday commended the role played by churches in partnering the Government in empowering citizens and responding to national needs. The call comes after some churches last year contributed towards helping the victims of Tropical Cyclone Idai in Manicaland and Masvingo provinces. Speaking at the Zimbabwe Assemblies of God Africa Forward in Faith Ministries (ZAOGA) in Faith’s 49th International Pastors Deeper Life Leadership Conference at Africa Multinational for Christ College (AMFCC) in Harare, President Mnangagwa said churches should partner the Government in empowering and responding to national needs. Led by its founder Archbishop Apostle Professor Ezekiel Guti, ZAOGA has a major following in various countries across the world. President Mnangagwa was invited to grace the occasion by Archbishop Apostle Professor Guti to attended the closing day of a weeklong training workshop which was attended by pastors drawn from 150 countries across the globe. <img class="size-full wp-image-470374" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/IMG_20200126_113023.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/IMG_20200126_113023.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/IMG_20200126_113023-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Apostles Eunor and Ezekiel Guti “Your church has also proved to be a reliable partner in empowering our citizens as well as responding to national needs. As Government, we are grateful for the contributions you made towards Cyclone Idai victims early last year. “We also recognise the hospitals, schools and university which you have established. These will go a long way in providing medical care and quality affordable education to our people. It is our hope as Government that other church administered schools nationwide will emulate you and charge reasonable school fees. As we converge at church assemblies, schools, hospitals and universities we come from diverse family backgrounds, social groups and political persuasions. Eventually, we become a family united by the blood, love and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,” he said. It was an electric atmosphere at AMFCC as thousands of ZAOGA pastors drawn from 150 countries across the globe cheered President Mnangagwa as he preaches the Word of God to them, much to the amazement. “The voice of the church must continue to inspire, motivate, guide and to harness, men, women and the youth as we gird and strengthen ourselves to grow our economy, to rid ourselves of corruption and end poverty,”.  “We must uphold a culture of hard work, determined to plant and reap what we would have sown. For the scriptures say we shall eat the labour of our sweat,’’
