THE Young Mighty Warriors are in Mozambique en-route to Blantyre where they will play Malawi in an Under-20 Womenâ€™s World Cup qualifier at Kamuzu Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The team left Harare on Thursday morning by road. Coach Rosemary Mugadza, who picked her final 18-member squad before departure is confident of a good outing but has warned against underrating the hosts, who have a vibrant schools league. Mugadza maintained the bulk of the team which featured in the inaugural COSAFA Under-20 Women Championships in August last year. Zimbabwe will host Malawi in the return leg on February 1 at Barbourfields. Team
