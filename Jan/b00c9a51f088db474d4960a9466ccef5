The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United thrashed League One outfit Tranmere Rovers 6-0 away from home yesterday in an FA Cup match to bring some cheer to the club. After the League One side shocked Watford, and with pressure on United, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer went for a full-strength side. On a difficult pitch, goals from Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Jesse Lingard, Phil Jones, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood, with a penalty, powered United through to the fifth round. Holders Manchester City cruised also into the FA Cup fifth round with a 4-0 thrashing of 10-man Fulham at the Etihad. Tim Ream’s sixth-minute red card gave the Championship side a mountain to climb after he hauled down Gabriel Jesus inside the box. Ilkay Gundogan converted the resulting penalty before Bernardo Silva’s smart turn and shot quickly doubled City’s advantage. The visitors then held out for nearly an hour but two headers in three minutes from Jesus gave the scoreline a more accurate reflection of the English champions’ dominance. Pep Guardiola’s men have now won 17 domestic cup ties in a row. The Catalan is relying on more cup success for silverware this season after conceding the Premier League title is beyond his side with Liverpool 16 points clear at the top of the table. Guardiola made eight changes to the team that won 1-0 at Sheffield United in midweek, but still named a strong side with both David and Bernardo Silva and Gundogan among those coming into the team. — AFP/Agencies.
