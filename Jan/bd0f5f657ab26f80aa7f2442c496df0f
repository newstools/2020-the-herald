The Herald CAPE TOWN. – South Africa’s Proteas still have a mountain to climb if they are to save the second Test cricket against England at Newlands, but they have given themselves a fighting chance thanks largely to Pieter Malan’s 63* (193) on debut yesterday. At stumps on day two, the hosts were 126/2, still needing a highly improbable 312 victory with eight wickets in hand. The more likely play on today’s final day will be for the Proteas to seek survival, and in that regard, they now have a glimmer of hope with Malan and nightwatchman Keshav Maharaj (2*) at the crease. Malan’s Cape Cobras team-mate Zubayr Hamza (18 off 59) lost his wicket to James Anderson in the second-last over of play. The resilience of Malan ultimately salvaged what could have been a disastrous day for the Proteas after England obliterated their bowling attack on the fourth morning. It was a woeful opening session for the hosts, who curiously delayed taking the new ball for five overs as Ben Stokes’ blistering 72 (47) rocketed England into what will surely be an unassailable position. There was also a maiden Test century for opener Dom Sibley, who finished 133* (311) as England declared their second innings at 13:32 and on 391/8 having amassed a staggering 157 runs in the 27-over session before lunch. The Proteas started the day with Dwaine Pretorius (1/56 in 16) and Maharaj (2/160 in 43) bowling while Kagiso Rabada (2/69 in 20) and Vernon Philander (0/24 in 14) were bizarrely not used immediately.  –Sport24.
