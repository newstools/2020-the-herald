The Herald LIVERPOOL. — Liverpool spent much of the last 30 years living in Manchester United’s shadow, but after three decades their time to be crowned champions of England again is nigh. A 2-0 win over United at Anfield on Sunday night put the European football champions 16 points clear at the top of the English Premier League and 30 points ahead of fifth-placed United, with a game in hand to come on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side just 22 matches into the season. Even in United’s heyday as they reeled in and overtook Liverpool’s record of 18 English titles by reaching 20 under Alex Ferguson was there ever such a gulf between the sides as there is now. Sunday’s scoreline flattered the visitors, who needed the aid of VAR and a tight offside call to deny Liverpool two more goals. By then, United already trailed to Virgil van Dijk’s header as the Dutchman towered above the man who replaced him as the world’s most expensive defender, Harry Maguire, to put Liverpool on their way to a 13th consecutive league win. Two years on from his £75 million move from Southampton, Van Dijk has been a transformative figure in turning Liverpool from flakey entertainers into serial winners under Jurgen Klopp. — AFP.
