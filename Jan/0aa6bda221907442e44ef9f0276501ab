NJERAMA Boys leader Paradzai Mesi has described 2020 as a great year, with big projects already in the pipeline. Mesi said his group is scheduled to perform in Mozambique in May, amid revelations that Njerama Boys will release a new album shortly. Mesi’s manager, Alfred Jusa, said preparations were underway for the Mozambique show and promised to deliver their best. “Our show is scheduled to take place on May 1 and we already have started planning,” he said. “We are going to perform at the Nhamhatanda Concert and this is to bring sungura close to its Mozambican fans.” Jusa said Mesi was not new to sungura music lovers in Mozambique, having staged a splendid show last year which left fans crying for more. “We are going back to Mozambique by popular demand,” he said. Mesi said he was excited to be sharing the stage with some Mozambican artistes. He did not hint on any collaboration, but said something big was coming this year. “I am privileged to share the stage with some artistes from Mozambique and we will be playing the music as per our fans’ request,” said Mesi. “With the assistance of our promoter, who stays in Mozambique, we will be able to get a list of their favourite songs prior to the event to enable us to prepare well.” Mesi said his group was working on a new album and was shooting videos for songs on the previous album.
