The Herald France, along with Digital Africa, will give 1 000 African entrepreneurs the opportunity to participate in the Africa-France Summit in Bordeaux, France, from June 4 to 6 next year. The winners of the Challenge of 1 000 competition will be the ones supported to attend the summit. During the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron will welcome leaders and stakeholders from across Africa. The Summit will focus on tailor-made solutions and concrete partnerships for sustainable cities. “By combining political vision, business expertise, ethical investment and civil contribution the best projects emerge – sustainable projects. The upcoming Africa-France Summit 2020 is the place to show how it is done,” said Secretary General of the Africa-France 2020 Stéphanie Rivoal in Pretoria on Monday. The winners of the Challenge of 1 000, along with other entrepreneurs, will be able to present their new ideas, projects or companies at the summit in order to seek funding and new partners. —Bloomberg.
