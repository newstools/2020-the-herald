The Herald Sports Reporter TheDeputy Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation, Tinoda Machakaire, has urged organisations, individuals and politicians to join hands with the Government in supporting sporting talent at grassroots. Speaking at a sports tournament held by Zvimba North MP, Marrian Chombo, Machakaire said there was need to support talent in the communities by providing platforms for the youth to express themselves and opportunities for nurturing. “We need to capacitate our youth by developing their talents like this. Today we are in Honourable Chombo’s constituency tomorrow we go to Honourable Philip Chiyangwa’s constituency developing talent. As a ministry we are fully behind that,” Machakaire said. He said there was need to motivate the youth with talent of different disciplines. “Let’s not focus on soccer and netball alone, we need to see all sporting activities, basketball, chess, pool and rugby so that we encourage them to take their talents forward,” he said. The youthful MP said his Ministry would give maximum support to such activities that encourage the development of sports at grassroots level. <img class="wp-image-326592 size-medium" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/0311-1-1-PHILLIP-360x225.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="225" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/0311-1-1-PHILLIP-360x225.jpg 360w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/11/0311-1-1-PHILLIP.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" /> Philip Chiyangwa “As the Government we are fully supporting people like Honourable Chombo.
