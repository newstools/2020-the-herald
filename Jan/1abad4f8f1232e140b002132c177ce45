The Herald BARCELONA. — Barcelona have been dealt a huge blow in their quest for success as Luis Suarez has been ruled out for four months after undergoing knee surgery. The Uruguayan striker could be set to miss the rest of the season after he decided with the club it would be best to go ahead with the operation, after struggling with a meniscus issue for a number of months. It was originally believed the 32-year-old would only miss up to six weeks of action because of the injury which was first sustained at the end of last season. However, Barcelona have now confirmed through their official club website that Suarez will be out of action for four months. The injury deals a massive dent to Barcelona’s hopes of retaining the La Liga title and also in their pursuit of the Champions League. Suarez missed the end of the 2018-19 season after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery to treat a medial meniscus injury on the same knee. — MailOnline.
