The Herald ST GEORGE’S. — Dwayne Bravo was recalled to the West Indies cricket squad on Sunday, more than three years after his last appearance as the Caribbean side build up to the defence of their World Twenty20 title. The 36-year-old all-rounder, a two-time World T20 winner, was named in a 13-man squad for a three-match series against Ireland later this month. However, the West Indies are thinking long-term with the next World Cup in the game’s shortest format taking place in Australia in October and November. Bravo last played for the T20 side against Pakistan in September 2016 before he quit to concentrate on franchise cricket.
