The Herald MANCHESTER. — Manchester City will resist any attempt by Arsenal to sign John Stones in the January transfer window. Former City No. 2 Mikel Arteta has been linked with a move for the England defender after he was appointed as Arsenal boss last month. But it’s understood that City have no plans to sell any players in this window and certainly not centre-backs after struggling in that department for most of the season. Pep Guardiola has been forced to play Fernandinho in central defence after City lost out to Manchester United in the race for Harry Maguire last summer and Aymeric Laporte then suffered a serious knee injury in August. Laporte has recently returned to training but Guardiola still needs Stones as his team continues to compete in four competitions. The 25-year-old has struggled with injury and loss of form this season, starting only nine Premier League games and making one Champions League appearance off the bench. It has led to concerns over Stones’ England place ahead of Euro 2020 with Gareth Southgate keen for his players to be starting for their clubs. Although his future is likely to come under scrutiny again in the summer, four years after a £47.5 million move from Everton, he will not be allowed to leave this month. — Mailonline.
