The Herald Embattled state airline SAA has cancelled dozen of local and international flights for February as it seeks to cut costs and conserve cash. The announcement comes two days after the flag carrier’s business rescue practitioners confirmed that the Development Bank of Southern Africa had committed R3,5 billion in funding to keep the airline operational. “Flight demand has been scrutinised to ensure SAA is running efficient flights,” the flag carrier said in a statement on Thursday. “To this end, SAA will therefore cancel and consolidate selected scheduled flights where there is low demand based on current forward bookings for the month of February.” The cancellations include numerous local and international flights for February, including flights departing and landing in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, East London, Windhoek, Nairobi and more. “We are committed to accommodating all affected customers on alternative flights, operated by the airline and its Star Alliance partners. Any inconvenience or delays are intended to be minimal,” said Philip Saunders, the airline’s chief commercial officer. — Fin24.
