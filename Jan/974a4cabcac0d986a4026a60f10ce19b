FIVE people died when two vehicles collided on Sunday evening along the Masvingo-Beitbridge Road near Ngomahuru Turn-Off. Police said two of the deceased were burnt beyond recognition when the other vehicle caught fire.
Deputy national police spokesperson Chief Superintendent Blessmore Chishaka said the accident occurred around 5.30pm at the 42km peg along the highway. “A woman was driving a Honda Fit along Masvingo-Beitbridge Road towards Masvingo. Upon reaching the 42km peg, another motorist who was driving in the opposite direction, overtook in front of oncoming traffic resulting in a head-on collision,” he said. He said the vehicle that was travelling towards Beitbridge caught fire.

The bodies of all the victims were taken to Masvingo Hospital mortuary. “Names of the deceased will be announced once their close relatives have been notified. Motorists are, however, urged to be cautious, keep a safe distance and avoid overtaking when conditions do not allow,” Chief Supt Chishaka said.
