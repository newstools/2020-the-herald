The Herald LOS ANGELES. — Miley Cyrus has settled a lawsuit over her 2013 track “We Can’t Stop”. The 27-year-old singer was sued by Michael May in a $300 million lawsuit in March 2018 over rights to the song, which he claimed closely resembles the lyrics to a song he released more than 25 years ago called “We Run Things”. Michael, who performs as Flourgon, sang the lyrics: “We run things. Things no run we,” while the Nothing Breaks Like a Heart hitmaker sings the line: “We run things, things don’t run we.” However, it has now been revealed that all parties have agreed that “this action shall be discontinued with prejudice … with each party to bear its or his own costs and attorneys’ fees.’ “With prejudice” means that the plaintiff cannot pursue the same claim in another suit. This comes almost a year after Miley failed to get the case dropped. Despite Miley’s attempt to get the suit thrown out, a judge ruled in February last year that the case could proceed. In documents obtained by The Blast, the judge noted: “In sum, analysis of the relevant factors strongly indicates that Defendant’s use of the phrase is a fair use. “Factual questions remain, however, as to certain of the fair use factors, particularly the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the needs of Defendants’ transformative use, and the effect on the market, if any, for May’s work. May also claimed both tracks feature a theme of “defiant audaciousness in the realm of self-discovery and self-governance”. — dailymailuk
