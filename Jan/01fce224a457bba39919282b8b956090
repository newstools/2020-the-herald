The Herald LONDON. — Mesut Ozil has taken aim at former Arsenal boss Unai Emery, suggesting the English Premiership football club had strayed from their key values under his leadership. The German midfielder fell out of favour under Emery during his 18 months in charge at the Emirates, starting just 20 league games last season. Under new manager Mikel Arteta, the 31-year-old has started every game, with the former Manchester City assistant tasting defeat just once in his opening five fixtures. Asked about the differences a regime change has brought about, Ozil did not hesitate in stating the positive change in mood now that Emery has been moved on. “It is basically getting us back to the old Arsenal virtues,” he said. “Fighting and having possession, being in control of the game, having the ball all the time. “These are the things that he is working on with us and you can see it — everyone is smiling, laughing, enjoying their time — it has made us successful. “I think he is the right man at this club.” — Mailonline.
