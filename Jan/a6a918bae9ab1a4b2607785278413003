NEWLY-PROMOTED Premiership football side Cranborne Bullets have taken a cue from their Zimbabwe National Army colleagues, Black Rhinos, to ease pressure on the only two stadiums in the capital. The Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera charges will use Lafarge Stadium in Mabvuku in the 2020 season. In a country lacking modern stadiums to host Premiership matches, teams from Harare were set to play double headers this coming season as only two facilities, the National Sports Stadium and Rufaro, are available for the seven top-tier clubs in the capital  — Dynamos, CAPS United, Black Rhinos, Yadah Stars, Herentals, Cranborne Bullets and Harare City. But Black Rhinos have since registered their willingness to play at Chinhoyi Stadium in Mashonaland West and fellow armed forces side Cranborne Bullets have followed suit. “We will be using Lafarge Stadium in Mabvuku for our home games this season,” said Saruchera.
