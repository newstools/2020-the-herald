The Herald California. — She topped the Golden Globes worst dressed lists for an outfit that turned her into a gift-wrapped present. But Jennifer Lopez shot to the top of the best dressed at the Critics’ Choice Awards on Sunday with an eye-catching cream-coloured gown. The 50-year-old Hustlers star was triumphant in the fashion department, though she was again bested by her fellow nominee Laura Dern, who won for Marriage Story. Jennifer was unmissable at the Golden Globes on January 5 in a voluminous white dress with a strange gold and green bow over her midriff that might have looked more at place under a Christmas tree. The baggy look hid most of the stunningly trim figure that she regularly shows off on Instagram, and she styled her hair in a crown of Teutonic braids. It was night and day with the actress and singer when she hit the red carpet for the Critics’ Choice Awards. She transformed her look with the sleek creamy gown, which featured a large sheer panel revealing her back and sides.— Daily Mail.
