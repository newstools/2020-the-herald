Sadc countries have nominated Zimpost chief executive Mr Sifundo Moyo as its candidate for the position of secretary-general at the next Pan-African Postal Union (PAPU) elections in June. The PAPU is a specialised institution of the African Union, whose objective is to coordinate all activities aimed at developing postal services on the continent. It was established by the constitutive plenipotentiary conference of African ministers in charge of postal services held in 1980 in Arusha, Tanzania. Over the weekend, PAPU hosted the 40th anniversary commemorations in Arusha where states were engaged on bilateral and multilateral levels. Zimbabwe’s Ambassador to Tanzania Anselem Sanyatwe, who represented Zimbabwe at the commemorations, said for the continent to show appreciation that Sadc had faithfully and constructively participated in PAPU, it was time the next secretary-general came from the region. He confirmed that Mr Moyo had been nominated to represent the Sadc region in the race for the post. “Apparently, the organisation holds a supreme conference once every four years and the last being in 2016 in Cameroon,” said Ambassador Sanyatwe. “During this event, the leadership of this organ is voted for, that is the secretary-general and his deputy. The current incumbents have finished their terms and it is from this background that Zimbabwe is fielding a candidate for the next PAPU secretary-general. “(Mr) Moyo has been endorsed by the country and the entire regional bodies and is the only Sadc candidate. The Zimbabwe delegation then had to remind the African community that Sadc had been there right from the inception of PAPU, but for 40 years, the leadership has rotated in the other regions but never given to Sadc,” he said. The theme for this year’s edition of PAPU Post Day was; “The Post: A veritable partner for financial inclusion and regional integration.”
