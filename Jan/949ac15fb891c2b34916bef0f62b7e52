The Herald NEW YORK. — Kanye West’s second faith-based project, Jesus Is Born, credited to Sunday Service Choir, the collective fuelling his Sunday Service live events, bullets at No. 2 for a second frame on Billboard’s Top Gospel Albums chart (dated January 11), following its first full week of tracking. From December 27 to January 2, the measurement period, the set earned 10 000 equivalent album units, according to Nielsen Music. The LP was released in the afternoon on December 25; after its first day-and-a-half of tracking, it debuted on Top Gospel Albums with 6 000 units. Meanwhile, West’s first spiritual set, Jesus Is King, leads the list for a 10th week. It debuted at No. 1 on Top Gospel Albums, as well as the Billboard 200, Top Christian Albums, Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums and Top Rap Albums on the charts dated November 9 (with 264 000 units), becoming the first title ever to top all five of those tallies. Sunday Service Choir concurrently notches its first top 10 on Hot Gospel Songs (which is fueled by streaming, airplay and sales data), as one of the album’s 19 tracks, “Father Stretch,” jumps 20-10 with 759 000 US streams However, on Hot Christian Songs, Riley Clemmons nets her first top 10, as “Fighting for Me” lifts 11-9.
