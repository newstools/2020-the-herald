The Herald stocks edged higher on Friday in tandem with other global markets which rebounded as concerns over a deadly virus in China took lesser priority. With markets in Shanghai closed for the Chinese lunar year, there was no sentiment which fed through from that market. There was trading on the Hang Seng which eventually closed 0,15 percent firmer while in Tokyo the Nikkei inched up 0,13 percent. Gains were much stronger in Europe were all the major indices advanced by more than a percent on average. Good corporate earnings release as well as sentiment from Europe helped US markets open firmer on Friday. Another mixed session ensued for the rand which rallied to peak at a session high of R14,31/$ before retracing to a session low of R14,41/$. At 1700 CAT, the rand was trading 0,08 percent weaker at R14.40/$. â€” fin24.com.
