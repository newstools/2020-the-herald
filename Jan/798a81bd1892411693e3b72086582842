The Herald Ellina Mhlanga, Sports Reporter WHILE a number of competitions having been held since the beginning of the month as the athletics season got underway, participation by senior athletes remain a concern despite an improved turnout for the Harare Athletic Board track and field championships over the weekend. The event held on Saturday at the National Sports Stadium B Arena attracted a number of top athletes mostly for the sprints but in the middle-distance events, most of the top athletes were missing in action. And for those that participated, some expressed concern as they said it affects the quality of competition. Some of the long-distance runners that took advantage of Saturday’s meet include Miriam Sibanda and Patience Murove. Sibanda came first in the junior women 3 000m in 10minutes 27.97seconds and Murove crossed the finish line in 4minutes 43.26seconds in the 1 500m race. Murove went on to claim the 800m race in 2minutes 22.14seconds and expressed satisfaction with the way her season is shaping up but noted that there is room for improvement. Tabitha Tsatsa also graced the competition and was second in 800m with a time of 2minutes 48seconds. Murove lamented the continued absence of some senior athletes as she said there won’t be much competition. “I am happy with my time, but the problem is some of the runners are not coming for the events. So sometimes it’s boring because I will be competing alone. “There is still room for improvement in my time and I still have time to work on it since I am still training. So I think I will improve. I am just happy it’s the beginning of the season,” said Murove. In other highlights of the meet, in the men’s section, Moses Tarakino emerged winner in the men’s 5 000m in 14minutes 45.12seconds. Kelvin Chiku was first in the 800m race in 1minute 53.65seconds.
