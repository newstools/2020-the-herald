The Herald Sports Reporter JUST a few days before the end of this month, the Zimbabwe Netball Association are yet to comply with the Sports Commission directive to conduct elections. The order was given in November. The association, led by president Leticia Chipandu, were ordered to recognise and register splinter league Rainbow Amateur. “The Sports and Recreation Commission has directed that ZINA, as the sole authority responsible for netball in Zimbabwe, register the Rainbow Amateur Netball League, subject to ZINA’s constitution lodged and registered with the Sports and Recreation Commission in 2007. Additionally, the Sports and Recreation Commission has directed that ZINA to convene an extraordinary general meeting to elect an executive. “The extraordinary general meeting should be concluded no later than January 31,” read the statement from the Sports Commission. But, a few days before the January 31 deadline, ZINA are yet to satisfy any of these processes Yesterday, RANL secretary-general Moses Gukurume said they were in the dark regarding the electoral process. “Nothing has happened, as to our knowledge, and we haven’t checked with SRC. “Probably the way forward will be mapped out at our AGM,” said Gukurume. RANL will hold their annual indaba on February 1. The decision by the Sports Commission was believed to be a major step in resolving the problems that have been rocking netball. The Sports Commission yesterday told The Herald that they would be in a position to comment today. ZINA, led by Chipandu, have been adamant they have not done anything wrong to warrant this action. Although Chipandu could not be reached to give an update ahead of the January 31 deadline, the veteran administrator has insisted that according to their 2013 constitution the association is not due for elections.
