The visit, he said attested to Zimbabwe’s stature as a must visit destination of choice. In his pledge, Mr Cerefin said much of what was said about Zimbabwe in some quarters was not true adding that Zimbabwe was a unique destination which needed to be correctly reflected across the world. “They said Zimbabwe is very dangerous, there is no water in Victoria Falls but we still came and people who know me, know that I am not a diplomat. “Zimbabwe is a fantastic country, with fantastic people, fantastic flora and fauna. We had a great time and we will promote Zimbabwe everywhere, trust me,” he said. According to the National Tourism Sector Strategy (NTSS) running from 2018 to 2030, Zimbabwe is seeking growth in tourism export earnings through effective marketing, product development and facilitation and access. The strategy also seeks to leverage on environmental sustainability, destination management, information communication technology, and human capital development.
