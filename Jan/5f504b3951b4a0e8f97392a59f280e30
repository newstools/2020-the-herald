The Herald LONDON. – The FA Cup is back again with a raft of fixtures spread out across the entire weekend all the way through until Monday night. Reigning champions Manchester City will face Fulham tomorrow for only the fourth time in the competition and for the first time in 106 years, a 2-0 win for City all the way back in 1914. Pep Guardiola’s men have won their last seven Emirates FA Cup matches, scoring 30 goals and conceding just four since a 1-0 defeat to Wigan in February 2018 while star striker Sergio Aguero needs just one more to be outright fourth-highest scorer in the competition. Tomorrow is also reserved for Liverpool’s trip to Shrewsbury Town with the teams having only ever faced off once previously, a fourth-round tie in February 1996 – the Reds won 4-0 at Gay Meadow. The Shrews should not be underestimated having lost just one of their last 17 home matches in the competition (W10 D6), a 3-0 defeat against Manchester United in February 2016. And Manchester United lie in wait for the winners of Tranmere and Watford’s replay on Thursday. This afternoon kicks off with Brentford versus Leicester and the Bees don’t have the best record against top flight opposition in the competition having progressed from just one of their last 12 meetings with Premier League opponents — a 2-1 win against Sunderland in January 2006.
