The Herald MELBOURNE. – Serena Williams crashed out, 15-year-old Coco Gauff stunned Naomi Osaka and Roger Federer survived a five-set thriller as the form book went flying out of the window at the Australian Open tennis tournament yesterday. Men’s title-holder Novak Djokovic eased into the last 16 but elsewhere there were surprises all over Melbourne Park with Williams the biggest victim and Federer fighting back from 4-8 down in a fifth-set tie-break with John Millman. Williams’ bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam was shattered by the unlikely figure of China’s Wang Qiang, who triumphed in three tough sets – after winning just one game when they played at the US Open in September. Gauff then stepped up her giant-killing Melbourne debut as she ousted Japanese defending champion Osaka ( 22) in dismissive style, winning 6-3, 6-4 in just 67 minutes to reach round four. “Oh my gosh. Two years ago I lost first round in the juniors and now I’m here – this is crazy,” said the teenager, who shocked Venus Williams in the first round. Federer came within a whisker of repeating his 2018 US Open upset by Millman as he was taken to five punishing sets by the tough Australian. The 20-time Grand Slam champion was facing defeat in the super tie-breaker but he clawed back from 4-8 down to clinch his 100th win at the Australian Open. “Oh God, it was tough,” said Federer. “Thank God it was a super tie-breaker (10 points), otherwise I would have lost this one. “It came down to the wire in the end.” With Williams now 38, 23 years older than Gauff, the two players are at opposite ends of their careers. And with Williams’ close friend Caroline Wozniacki retiring yesterday, after defeat to Ons Jabeur, it looked like a changing of the guard in women’s tennis. – AFP.
