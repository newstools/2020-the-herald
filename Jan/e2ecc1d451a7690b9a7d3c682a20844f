The Finance Act also brings into force a number of issues concerning taxes and other revenue collection mechanisms announced by Finance and Economic Development Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube when he presented the Budget. This includes the reduction of corporate tax, by 1 percent to 24 percent and Value Added Tax (VAT), from 15 to 14,5 percent. On tourism, Treasury extended rebates for imports of capital equipment and safari vehicles, suspended tax on car hire, tour operators and extended tax on luxury coach imports. The Act sets out the new excise duty on the importation of second hand vehicles ranging from $500  depending on date of manufacture and engine capacity. The Act brings in permanent law temporary amendments to the Reserve Bank Act banning the use of any currency for pricing local goods and services, except the Zimbabwe dollar and allowing civil penalties for those who breach this. It amends the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Act by providing for the establishment of the Monetary Policy Committee. The MPC was appointed in September and is chaired by RBZ Governor Dr John Mangudya. The committee’s functions include among others, to determine the monetary policy of the country, ensure price stability as defined by Government, inflation targets and determine the interest rates in line with the country’s economic policies and targets for growth and employment. Other measures that are contained in the Act include the fiscal incentive to support employers who create jobs for young people where an additional job created will attract a percentage tax rebate to the employer, linked to the employee’s salary.
