BLACK Rhinos team manager Jairos Tapera believes they have assembled a good foundation to see the army side return to their best after the introduction a vibrant junior policy structure. Rhinos are recruiting some Under-21 players who will be feeder to the senior team under the guidance of former Tongogara coach Ignatius Kapitapita. Tapera, who last worked with former Premiership football side TelOne as head coach, is coming in with experience to the side and said he will be working with young coaches and expects to do well this season. Chauya Chipembere began their pre-season by conducting trials at Motor Action Sports Club from Monday and are looking at replacing about 16 players who they have released due to various reasons. The well-travelled coach, who has an eye for talent, is expected to add value to the side, which he hopes can be achieved, and welcomed the move. “I think we are moving in the right direction as Black Rhinos and we are hopeful that we will be competitive this season. I am willing to bring my experience to the team. “Black Rhinos is not a small team and its high time we return to where we belong at the top. There is so much progress going on and I believe we will assemble a very competitive side. “The coaches have wealth of experience and given time they will deliver. Last season, the team was not that bad as they were in the race for the better part of the first season. We need to avoid complacency during this upcoming campaign,” said Tapera. Tapera is coming on board to the army side that will be using Chinhoyi Stadium as their home ground this season, and will work with head coach Herbert Maruwa and Thomas Ruzive in their technical department. During this week’s training session, some notable faces who turned up include Pride Tafirenyika, Simbarashe Gondo, Crybert Muvuti and Barnabas Mushunje, among others.
