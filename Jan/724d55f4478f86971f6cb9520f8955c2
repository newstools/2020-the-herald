The Herald POTCHEFSTROOM. — Sixteen-year-old Emmanuel Bawa must have had one of the sweetest experiences of his career yesterday. To score a century from No. 7 — with the team in deep trouble at 54 for 5 — and for it to end up match-winning too had to make him feel like he was on top of the world. Zimbabwe, at one point, were in very real danger of going down to Canada in Potchefstroom, but their lower-middle order showed great steel in this ICC Under-19 World Cup plate quarter-final. The No. 5 Taurayi Tugwete hit a 50 off 75 balls and even the No. 9 Gareth Chirawu wouldn’t give his wicket away cheaply, cracking 54 unbeaten runs off only 45 deliveries. Bawa, though, was the star of the show, arriving to the crease in the 16th over and remaining unbeaten, with 13 fours and a strike-rate of 110. Canada suffered a similar batting malfunction, slumping to 69 for 5 in the 21st over, but they could find no one to rescue their innings as Chirawu, Sakhumuzi Ndlela and Nkosilathi Nungu picked up two wickets each. Osama Hassan produced a fine half-century from the lower order for UAE but his 81 off 68 balls did little to prevent defeat in the fourth quarter-final of the plate group in the Under-19 World Cup. Scotland cruised to victory with seven wickets to spare thanks to opener Uzzar Shah’s nearly run-a-ball 71 and wicketkeeper Tomas Mackintosh’s better than run-a-ball 57. UAE began the game in decent position. They were 129 for 3 in the 30th over after being put in to bat, eying up a strong total. But Daniel Cairns’ offspin triggered a middle-overs collapse where they lost four wickets for 35 runs. Hassan continued to fight though, hitting seven fours and a six during the course of his innings and was the last man out in the 49th over. Shah took centre stage after that, helping Scotland wallop 176 runs by the 27th over before he was finally dismissed, by which time the contest was pretty much done. Scores Zimbabwe Under-19s: 271 for 7 (Bawa 105, Chirawu 54, Kumar 3-63) beat Canada Under-19s 176 all out (Bedi 26*, Ndlela 2-34, Nungu 2-35) by 95 runs Scotland Under-19s: 250 for 3 (Shah 71, Mackintosh 57) beat United Arab Emirates Under-19s 249 all out (Hassan 81, Aravind 61, Cairns 4-32) by seven wickets. —  Cricinfo.
