The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — South Africa’s rand firmed marginally yesterday, with sentiment towards emerging markets broadly boosted by US President Donald Trump’s announcement on the signing of a trade deal with China, and on higher commodity prices. By 0645 GMT, the rand strengthened 0,08percent to 14,0050 per dollar from its previous close of 14,0160, its recent rally slowing as investors re-assessed positions in the new year. Trump said on Tuesday the Phase 1 trade deal with China would be signed on January 15 at the White House, spurring demand for currencies of economies reliant on exports to the world’s two mega economies. The Chinese central bank’s decision on Wednesday to cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, a move set to boost economic activity, also cheered emerging market sentiment. — Reuters.
