As Minister of Government, the President said Mr Norman worked hard towards a unified, non-racial agricultural sector where farmers related toe ac other and collaborated on grounds of their calling and not along the racial divide of colonial times. “on behalf of the Nation of Zimbabwe which he loyally served, its Government of which he was part for so long and on my own behalf, I wish to express my heartfelt condolences to the Norman family on their saddest loss. May they derive comfort from the deep respect and regard which our nation continues to give him. May his soul rest in eternal peace,” he said.
