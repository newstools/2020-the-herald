The Herald ANGELO MATHEWS became Sri Lanka’s first double-centurion in five years, moments before the tourists declared their innings at 515/9 at Harare Sports Cub yesterday. They stretched their lead over Zimbabwe to 157 runs, going into the final day of the first Test match.
The Chevrons will now need to bat sensibly today in order to salvage a draw after openers Brain Mudzinganyama and Prince Masvaure put on an unbeaten 30 at close of play yesterday. The hosts suffered a setback as opening batsman Kevin Kasuza, who made his debut in this match, was ruled out of the remainder of the match after he was diagnosed with mild concussion.
The doors opened for another debutant Mudzinganyama. Under new regulations that came into effect on August 1 last year, a concussion replacement has to be a like-for-like substitute and Mudzinganyama will only be allowed to bat and not bowl. Kasuza was struck on the helmet while fielding at short-leg on Tuesday when Sri Lanka batsman Kusal Mendis pulled a ball from Ainsley Ndlovu. Yesterday Sri Lanka took control of the game courtesy of the batting prowess of their former captain, Mathews, who reached the double century milestone with a slog sweep off the bowling of Sikandar Raza. The Zimbabwe all-rounder had taken two wickets in two balls in his previous over to raise the possibility that Mathews would run out of partners before he got to 200. But No. 10 Kasun Rajitha was able to survive two balls from Raza before turning the strike over to Mathews, who waited for a fullish delivery to slam over square leg. All in all, he had batted an epic 468 deliveries.
Upon Rajitha’s dismissal in the next over, Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne declared the innings.
Sri Lanka had batted for 176.2 overs. That means Sri Lanka are the only side with a reasonable chance of winning this Test.
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe Under-19 suffered a 38-run defeat at the hands of Pakistan in an ICC Under-19 World Cup match in South Africa yesterday. Zimbabwe were bowled out for 255 in 46.3 overs chasing their opponents’ 294-9. Test Scores
