The Herald MILAN. — Cristiano Ronaldo stretched his goal-scoring streak to six consecutive league games as Juventus took top spot in the Italian Serie A football table on Sunday with a 2-1 win at Roma, whose defeat was made worse by the cruciate ligament injury of rising star Nicolo Zaniolo. Juventus move two points ahead of Inter Milan, who were held 1-1 by Atalanta at the San Siro on Saturday, after going two goals up in just 10 minutes in Rome. “We were very good for 60 minutes. Then, if you play against Roma, it is almost inevitable to suffer in the end,” said Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri. Turkish defender Merih Demiral found a way through after three minutes when he connected with a Paulo Dybala free-kick. Minutes later Argentine Dybala was hauled down in the box, and Ronaldo stepped up to convert from the spot to make it nine goals in six league games. “It’s tough playing against a team like Juventus and we gave away two early goals,” said Roma coach Paulo Fonseca. “We put in a good performance after that, against a great side. But once you go two goals down, it’s difficult.” Both sides had casualties in the first half with Demiral limping off with a knee injury not long after scoring his first Juventus goal. — AFP.
