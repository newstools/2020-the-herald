The Herald LONDON. — John Stones is a shock target for Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. The Manchester City centre-back wants first-team football to boost his Euro 2020 hopes. Stones is represented by the same agency as Arteta and would be keen to discuss a move — even if it is on loan. His season has been plagued by injury and loss of form and there has been no sign of a new contract offer from City with just two years left to run on his deal. There is a feeling City boss Pep Guardiola has lost faith in Stones and England boss Gareth Southgate wants his star men playing every week. Stones (25) was a key member of the City squad that won back-to-back titles was first choice for England at the 2018 World Cup. But he has fallen out of favour — playing just 10 Prem games this term. A source said: “He was in London to see his agent last week and is due back again this week. “He knows if he is to resurrect his England career he has to get more time on the pitch. “Arteta is in need of defenders so it could be perfect for both of them.” Stones did play in Sunday’s 6-1 win at Aston Villa. But with Aymeric Laporte injured, midfielder Fernandinho is being picked ahead of him. Arteta knows Stones well from his time as Guardiola’s No. 2 at City. And the new Gunners chief will make a move after allowing Greek centre-back Konstantinos Mavropanos (22) to join German side Nurnberg on loan. — The Sun.
