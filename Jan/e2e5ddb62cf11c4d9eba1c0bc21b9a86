The Herald Kundai Marunya Arts Correspondent After successfully building a brand that has seen him perform at many big stages this year, fast-rising afro-fusion musician Ashton “Mbeu” Nyahora has set his sights on the international market. The musician wrapped up 2019 with an explosive collaboration featuring American reggae star Rasun, in the song “Moyo neRudo”. The single has been doing well on radio, especially reggae themed shows. Mbeu’s manager Eugene Museredza said they planned to broaden their reach. “We are happy the work plan we had for 2019 worked well,” he said. “We managed to achieve the majority of our targeted goals. “One of the major areas we will be working on this year is penetrating the international market with our music, videos and live performances.” Last year, Mbeu had several shows in South Africa, including performances at the Capetown Jazz Festival. Museredza said they will use strategic collaborations to achieve their goal. “We have a variety of key result areas, including focusing on strategic collaborations, locally, continentally, and outside Africa so as to cross pollinate our fan bases with the artists we will work with and grow as a brand,” he said. Museredza said they were working on a video for “Moyo neRudo”. “We are in the process of doing our video with Rasun,” he said. “We are taking advantage of the slow pace of showbiz this January to finalise the video. “We will also be releasing another single, a collaboration with a Ugandan artist this February.” A protégé of the late Oliver Mtukudzi, Mbeu has been in the music industry since 2012 as part of the Starbrite finalists. He was once part of afro-fusion band Tsvete as a lead vocalist, but left the group to start his solo career. Working with his band, Mhodzi Tribe, Mbeu has performed at different platforms, including the annual Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA), Jacaranda Music Festival, and Capetown Jazz Festival.
