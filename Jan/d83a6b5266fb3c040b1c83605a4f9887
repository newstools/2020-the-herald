The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Ageing like a fine wine, Golden Arrows goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda is the true epitome of this adage. The Zimbabwean international seems to be getting better with age as it’s only now where he’s getting regular game-time, something that eluded him in his youth as a footballer. The 33-year-old Sibanda proved his credentials when he started in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) last year against hosts Egypt, where he picked up a knee contusion that all but ended his campaign. He was still on the books of South African second-tier side Witbank Spurs at the time, who were relegated last season. “It was very special to start that game against Egypt. I can say that I didn’t foresee that at my age I would still be going strong with the national team it’s amazing,” Sibanda said. What made his case at AFCON even more interesting was that he was preferred ahead of George Chigova and Elvis Chipezeze, who turn out for South African elite sides in Baroka and Polokwane City respectively, while he was still playing in the second-tier for Spurs. “In as much as it’s competition, it’s just about pushing each other. We (he, Chipezeze and Chigova) are friends. After each and every game we talk to each other, sharing advice,” said Sibanda. “I think what worked for me to go to AFCON was that people in Zim know me very well as I played for the Under-20 and Under-23 teams he claimed the Abafana. — KickOff.com
