ZIMBABWE won eight medals at the inaugural 2020 Pan Africa Games whose curtain came down yesterday at the Cairo International Stadium in Egypt. Team Zimbabwe added three more medals yesterday to bring their total medal haul to eight in the athletics events. Barbra Njovo won her second gold medal after a spectacular dash in the 200m, to add to the one she had won on Tuesday in the 100m. Kadoma-based Cleo Mero, pulled strongly in the last 50m to win bronze in the same race. But, it was Njovo who lived up to her pre-Games billing with a good show that saw her being the poster girl of the Games â€“ appearing on the front page of the Games newsletter. The athlete used her experience, from the Special Olympics World Games in Abu Dhabi last year where she won a silver medal, to her advantage. Team captain, Patience Zvikomborero Mudarikwa, was also on the podium with a silver medal in the 200m race and rounded it off with a gold medal in the 400m. Lisalobuhle Hleza, recorded improvements with each race, surprised everyone with a spirited acceleration in the last 50m to win a silver medal in the 100m final race. The athletes are expected to take a tour of Cairo by visiting the Pyramids, The Spinx and possibly a boat cruise on the Nile. Over 1 000 athletes from 47 African countries, with Special Olympics Programmes, participated in the competition which lasted one week.
