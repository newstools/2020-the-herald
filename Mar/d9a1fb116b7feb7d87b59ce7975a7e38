Rising Afro-fusion musician, Maizon Tazvitya, has added his voice to the issue of children who are left destitute after their parents leave the country to seek greener pastures in the Diaspora. The former banker-cum-musician, who has been shuttling between Zimbabwe and South Africa, depicted the life of a single mother who leaves her daughter to seek greener pastures in his new song “KwaMungezi”. “In this song, I try to facilitate a discussion and open society’s eyes on how tough it is for single mothers having to fend for children and how it’s not always fruitful in the Diaspora,” explained Tazvitya. “The daughter who is now in her teens is faced with the reality that her mother could have died in the Diaspora and she has to look after herself as the community often ostracises children raised by single mothers.” “KwaMungezi” comes off the musician’s debut album “Pfumvudza” to be released next month. “Pfumvudza” is a process by which vegetation renews itself on the onset of the rains. People start preparing for the rainy season at this time. “This aptly describes how I see my music as now having matured, ready to serenade listeners who are craving for more,” said Tazvitya, who is a product of Chipawo. Though this may be his first album, Tazvitya is not new to music having released a single, “Majurumbwe”, in 2012. He has since recorded a number of singles, including “Tamari” and “Rukweza”, that received decent airplay on local radio, encouraging him to leave his job as a banker to pursue a full-time career in music. “Pfumvudza” was recorded at Cornelius Muponda’s Harmony Studios, while production was done by Mehluli Moyo “Taz”, of Africa Revenge fame. Tazvitya was born and raised in Dzivarasekwa, Harare. He attended Courtney Selous Primary and St John’s Chikwaka schools. He fronts the Ancient Band which has shared the stage with popular musicians, including the late superstar Oliver Mtukudzi and Progress Chipfumo.
