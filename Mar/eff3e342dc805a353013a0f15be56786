The Herald LONDON — Mauricio Pochettino has hit out at European football’s “irresponsible” leaders for being too slow to react to the coronavirus crisis. The ex-Spurs boss, who lives in Barcelona, has also revealed he has been in touch with his former players urging them to put themselves first and football second. The English Premier League announced a suspension of games after Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta contracted the virus a week ago. UEFA followed suit after a video conference call earlier this week. Pochettino Europe’s leaders should have acted far more swiftly to take protective measures. “They handled themselves irresponsibly and made late decisions,” he said. “I understand that the economic aspect comes into play in football and is a deciding factor much of the time, but seeing everything that is happening, I think that in Europe, they managed irresponsibly and made late decisions.” Pochettino led Spurs to the Champions League final last season before being replaced by Jose Mourinho in November. But he revealed he told his former players to do all they can to look after themselves and their families. “I told them that there is no need to be at risk and that football takes second place to health,” Pochettino told Radio Del Plata. “It seems good to me that measures have already been taken. It is the best way to try to control the virus until a cure is found.” On Thursday the Premier League announced that there would be no resumption of top-flight football in England until April 30 at the earliest, extending their previous date of April 4. It was also agreed that the season would be extended indefinitely to ensure that the 2019/20 season was allowed to be played until a finish. — The Mirror
