The Herald An African Union-led Contact Group meeting on Libya took place in the Republic of Congo yesterday. It is under the auspices of the Congolese president Denis Sassou Nguesso who is chair of the AU’s High-Level committee on Libya. Unlike the last meeting that took place in the capital Brazzaville, yesterday’s meeting took place in Oyo, a town located in the country’s north. Last month in Addis Ababa, on the sidelines of the 33rd AU Summit, leaders agreed to establish the Contact Group to, in the words of South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, “provide political leadership and to promote the coordination of international efforts in pursuit of a lasting solution to the Libyan crisis. Ramaphosa bemoaned the continued military offensive in the North African country since the last AU summit. “The ongoing strife in Libya has dangerous repercussions for the security and stability of the region and the continent in general.” —africa news.
