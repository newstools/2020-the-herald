The Herald SYDNEY. — Football might have ground to a halt across the world, but not in Australia where they are soldiering on, with a handful of fans turning up to cheer on their teams outside shuttered grounds this weekend. The domestic A-League has six rounds to go and Football Federation Australia decided to press ahead without spectators amid the coronavirus pandemic, despite two of the 11 teams undergoing mandatory quarantine. Like rugby league and Australian Rules, which are also pushing on with their seasons, it has lucrative broadcast commitments with the fear of financial repercussions part of the thinking. In opting to keep going, Football Federation Australia head of leagues Greg O’Rourke said they were adhering to government directives and expert medical advice. “We understand that these are difficult times for everyone,” he said. “We will always put the health, welfare and safety of our players, coaches, match officials, volunteers, administrators and fans at the centre of our decision-making process.” Australia is far from immune to the virus, and has sealed its borders, banning entry to anyone who is not a citizen or permanent resident from Friday evening, with more than 1 000 cases confirmed. While the action continued, there were only four fixtures. That’s because Wellington Phoenix and Melbourne Victory are serving mandatory 14-day quarantine stints after playing in New Zealand last weekend and failing to get back to Australia before tough new entry rules took effect. — AFP
