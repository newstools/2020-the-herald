ZIMBABWE’S women beach volleyball team suffered a heartbreak in their quest for a ticket to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games when they finished a distant fifth at a qualifying tournament held in Uganda this week. Zimbabwe were in Group D where they competed against some of Africa’s beach volleyball heavyweights, who included Egypt, Mozambique, Guinea Conakry and the hosts Uganda. Egypt and Mozambique qualified to the 2020 CAVB Continental Cup finals finishing first and second respectively. Egypt clinched gold with 30 points with Mozambique on 27 points. The Egyptians managed to defeat Mozambique in a closely contested golden set match. The Zimbabwean women finished on fifth place with 13 points trailing behind the hosts Uganda who were on fourth with 17 points and Guinea Conakry who sat on third position with 19 points. The team were without their head coach Kudzanai Sibangani who did not travel with the team due to lack of funds. Zimbabwe kicked off their campaign with an early blow from Guinea Conakry after they were defeated 2-1 in their opening match. They played against Uganda in their second match and were defeated 2-1 by the hosts before the Egyptians added misery on them after they defeated them 2-0. Mozambique also managed to extend their impressive winning form after they defeated Zimbabwe 2-0. Zimbabwe beach volley coach Kudzanai Sibangani earlier blamed the girls defeat on fatigue and lack of time to adjust to the playing caught. “There is probably an element of little rest at play and adjustment to the sand as the team only arrived seven hours before their opening match,” said Sibangani.
