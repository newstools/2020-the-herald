BRIDGET STIDOLPH yard dominated the first Triple Tiara event, the Zimbabwe Guineas (Gr3) race, at Borrowdale Park on Sunday. The trainer had Lily Blue, who romped to victory in the 1600m race, beating some colts and geldings in the process. At five-years, Lily Blue continued with her fine form as she also won the Fillies Classic, which had the same distance early last month. Partnering Mathew Thackery, as the pilot, the daughter of Black Minnaloushe (US) dominated throughout. Stable companions Wantage and Prescott followed her home. Gorkhan Terzi was represented by Fire To The Rein who ran fourth with Hennie Greyling on the irons. During the afternoon, Vanessa Birketoft, assistant trainer to Gokhan Terzi, saddled five of the winners on the eight-race card â€” all with Deon Sampson aboard. Kirk Swanson teamed up with Devin Habib and won two races.
