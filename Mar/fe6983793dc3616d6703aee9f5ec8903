The Herald Herald Reporter A 25-year-old female student from the Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University, who was admitted to the university’s clinic on Friday after presenting with a history of a flu-like illness, has tested negative to coronavirus (COVID-19). The Ministry of Health and Child Care said in a statement, the student was assessed by the COVID-19 Rapid Response Team, which was called in by a nurse at the clinic and it found out that she did not meet the World Health Organisation case definition of a suspected case. “She was, therefore, managed appropriately and due to intensified surveillance, samples were also collected for COVID-19 testing and results were negative,” the Ministry said. The student had travelled to China
on February 5 and had a one-day lay-over in South Africa. She returned to South Africa on February 27 and came back the next
day. The ministry said she had no contact with anyone with flu-like illness outside the country, but she only came in contact with one of her dormitory mates who had the symptoms on March 10, but had no history of travel outside the country. The ministry said it will continue to intensify surveillance and screening for COVID-19. “As of March 13, 2020, more than 9 700 travellers have been screened at our ports of entry and put on surveillance,” it said. “The National Microbiology Reference Laboratory has tested 14 suspected cases for COVID-19 and all were negative “The ministry, therefore, would like to reassure the nation that to date, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe.”
