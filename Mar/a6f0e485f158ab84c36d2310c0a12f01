The Herald German sportswear company Puma announced yesterday that 1 400 staff would switch to shorter work hours until April 13 as sales slump due to the coronavirus and said its three top executives would not take their pay for April. Germany allows companies to apply for state aid to keep people working but switch to shorter hours. A Puma spokeswoman said almost all the shops that Puma and its partners operate had been closed due to the coronavirus. Employees at the company’s headquarters in the southern German town of Herzogenaurach and in its own stores will now work only half of their usual hours, but will still be paid their full salary due to the short-time work allowance. – Reuters.
