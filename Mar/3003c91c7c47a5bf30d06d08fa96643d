The Herald Gold prices hit a more than seven-year high yesterday as a stock market rout on concerns over the widening coronavirus outbreak and its economic impact drove investors to safe-haven assets, although profit taking later unwound much of the metal’s rise. In a volatile session, spot gold touched its highest since December 2012 at $1 702,56 before being knocked back to stand 0,5percent lower at $1 665,68 per ounce by 0926 GMT. US gold futures shed 0,4 percent to $1,666. “Traders had put $1,700 as their (price) target, so there was a lot profit-taking once that target was reached,” said Avtar Sandu, a senior commodities manager at Phillip Futures. He added that part of the selling was because of the need to meet margin calls as the fast-spreading virus landed a sharp blow on global equities.- Reuters.
