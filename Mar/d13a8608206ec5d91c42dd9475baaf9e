THE Zimbabwe Open will not return to the local golfing calendar, for now, after the suspension of all Sunshine Tour activities due to the coronavirus outbreak. The country was set to host its premier golf tournament at Royal Harare from April 2-5. The Zimbabwe Open was cancelled last year after the organisers failed to get the foreign currency, needed to hold it, from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. The Sunshine Tour issued a statement advising they would revise their calendar after April 20. “The Sunshine Tour will be suspending all of its activities as of March 16,’’ the tour said. “The Sunshine Tour will review its position on April 20 or as the situation demands. “This decision was taken by the Sunshine Tour Board of Directors and Players Committee, and stands in unity with the International Federation of PGA Tours and world golf’s decision to suspend its activities. “Our aim is to both safeguard our members and our loyal fans, and support the President’s (Cyril Ramaphosa) call for all South Africans to present a united front in taking the prescribed action to prevent the further spread of this virus. “As such, the Sunshine Tour has instituted an immediate international and domestic air travel ban for all of our staff. “The Sunshine Tour’s Head Office will be closed throughout this period, but all communication will carry on as per normal as staff will work remotely and in designated teams.’’
