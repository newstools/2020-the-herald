The Herald ZIFA have announced the arrival of inspectors from the Confederation of African Football to conduct preliminary inspection on the country’s stadiums. The Herald reported last week that some CAF inspectors were set to arrive in this country to look at the National Sports Stadium and Barbourfields. Both stadiums are under renovation. ZIFA spokesperson said the inspectors were not for the 2021 AFCON qualifiers, including the match the Warriors are set to play the Desert Foxes at the end of this month, but for the 2022 World Cup qualifiers. ‘’Following the draw of lots conducted to determine groups for 2022 World Cup qualifiers held in January, the Confederation of African Football is conducting inspections on stadiums that the Zimbabwe Football Association earmarked for World Cup qualifiers,’’ Gwesela said in a statement. ‘’The inspection team seconded by CAF, Derek Blackensee and Mark Anthony Fish from South Africa, will assess the National Sports Stadium and Barbourfields’ suitability to host the FIFA World Cup qualifier set for later this year. ‘’The first phase of the inspection, which will indicate areas that need to be improved, takes place from the 12 to 13 March while the follow up and final phase to determine suitability to host World Cup qualifiers will be held any time before 1 August 2020. ‘’ZIFA appeals to all stakeholders to continue working towards up-liftment of our stadia to satisfy international standards. ‘’It is our fervent hope that in the near future we can have not only National Sports Stadium and Barbourfields hosting international matches, but more stadia across the country. ‘’There is not much time between now and August, but within that space Zimbabwe can do what needs to be done to retain our right to play home matches in Zimbabwe.’’ — Sports Reporter/ZIFA.
