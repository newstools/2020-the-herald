The Herald Kundai Marunya Arts Correspondent Sungura artiste Romeo Gasa has made it his life’s mission to spread love to the underprivileged, especially the disabled. He first made public his charity works when he roped in blind street musician Daniel Gonora for his album launch last year. Proceeds from that show went towards Gonora’s upkeep, while some were donated to disadvantaged people across the country. This was not Gasa’s first charity initiative, having been paying for the upkeep of different disabled people. “I’ve always been drawn to disadvantaged groups, especially the disabled,” he said. “They usually come to me showing their support and realising their needs, I then try to help in whichever way I can, sometimes by paying their school fees, buying food and clothing for them.” Gasa said his foundation had beneficiaries in Kariba, Mhangura, Karoi and Mberengwa, among other areas. “I pay school fees for three pupils at Nyamhunga Primary in Kariba, two pupils at Kasimure Primary in Karoi, and three others at a school in Mhangura, unfortunately I can’t remember the names,” said Gasa. “I also support those out of school in their different needs.” Gasa, who turns 33 tomorrow, said he will celebrate his birthday with pupils at Danhiko Special School. “I’m going to Danhiko to spend time with children there on Sunday, performing for them for free, he said. “I will take cakes with me so that they can help me celebrate. “I’m busy running around trying to find donations to take with me, but I believe just spending time entertaining them and making them feel special is a greater donation.” As part of his birthday celebrations, Gasa will be staging shows at Jameson Hotel tonight and on Sunday evening at Club Manucho in Waterfalls.
