THE Premier Soccer League has reinstated new boys Tenax into the topflight league after the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services side finally paid their affiliation fees. PSL Communications and Media Liaison Officer Kudzai Bare confirmed this afternoon that the Mutare side is now in good standing and has been cleared by the league’s Emergency Committee. “The Premier Soccer League Emergency Committee has resolved to admit Tenax FC as a member of the Premier Soccer League after the club made full payment of the membership, subscription fees and security deposit. “The club is expected to submit its player registration documents by 31 March 2020 in preparation for the 2020 Castle Lager PSL season,” said Bare. However, fellow ZPCS side Whawha are still struggling to raise the fees and have reportedly been given a final deadline of Friday March 27.
According to PSL, new entrants are supposed to fork out a $208 010 affiliation fee. This amount comprises a membership fee of $107 841. 25, a security deposit of $51 150 and a subscription fee of $49 018,75.
