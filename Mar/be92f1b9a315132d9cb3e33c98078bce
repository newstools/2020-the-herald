The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Fashion 263 Another week has passed and hope you achieved what you had planned to do. Like they say, in order to be irreplaceable you must be different. Just stand your stamp in the fashion world, be known for your creation. LOL! So Saturday is for shopping, this then reminds me, first to use this opportunity as a fashion specialist that it begins with you, at home and workplace. Of  late we have heard the news about the pandemic coronavirus dubbed COVID-19. Glamour Magazine deputy beauty editor, Elle Turner said it is time to sanitise your makeup bag and she shared some of her tips. The emerging pandemic has made most people panic. She said it starts with washing our hands thoroughly and frequently. “But, beyond that it includes making sure our environment, is as clean as possible whether that is at work, if you are still going, or at home. This means sticking sofa throws, cushion covers, bed sheets, towels and tea towels be washed regularly and making sure anything that’s going in our mouths (cutlery and cups) and on our faces (foundations, face creams and fingers) are sanitary,” she said. Which brings us to how women treat their makeup bags. <img class="wp-image-479419 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/2003-1-1-CLEANING-MAKEUP-TOOLS-HERO.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/2003-1-1-CLEANING-MAKEUP-TOOLS-HERO.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/2003-1-1-CLEANING-MAKEUP-TOOLS-HERO-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Ladies, be a hero this women’s month, clean that make up kit It is more important than ever that we up our hygiene standards now. The same rules as before still apply. Products that are past their expiry date should be retired — not only will the preservatives have become ineffectual but they will have had months to accumulate dirt and grime, making them doubly gross. So, empty out the entire contents and set aside the bits you don’t use on a daily basis. Anything that does not make the cut because it is run out or too old should be binned (responsibly). Anything you want to keep but don’t use very often should be wiped down with an alcohol spray and stored away. And anything going back into your makeup bag should be thoroughly sanitised (by wiping down the packaging and the product itself if it’s exposed to air, like bronzers, lipsticks and powder blushers) with the alcohol spray. Brushes and makeup sponges need extra attention, so wash them thoroughly with warm water and an antibacterial soap to clean them, rubbing them gently until the water runs clear. Leave them to dry on a clean towel with the tip hanging over the side of a solid surface so they can resume their shape, then once dry, spritz them with the alcohol spray to ensure they’re completely sanitised. Thank you Turner and back to everyone, whether you like it or not, COVID-19 is real and prevention is better than cure. Cleanliness is next to Godliness. Consistent, frequent hand washing helps kill the germs and slow the spread of bacteria and viruses that can cause colds and the flu. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to get to a sink with soap and water, that is why they are telling us to always buy and move around with a hand sanitiser. Apart from dressing the part, the issue here is sanitisers and observing the precaution measures which are being issued by health officials. Make sure you always wash your hands and avoid being among crowds greeting each other. Back to the closet and still women’s month celebrations — this week we focus on how fashion industry has dominated in the music sector with local women competing not on the microphone but on the hanger too. Some of the local musicians who include Ammara Brown, Janet Manyowa, Tammy Moyo and Gemma Griffiths among others are embracing the culture of fusing fashion in their music videos. Recently Multi-Award winning gospel diva Janet Manyowa caused a stir with her fashion statement in a new video “Mbiri” by Tembalani where  she featured. Well, this is not the first time though as late last year she dropped the video “Ndimi” and is known to have engaged popular local award winner designers such as Tapfumaneyi Munenga — Coco, Zarguesia and HL Classic. The revolutionary is real hence it is of paramount importance that it be recorded especially this month. These musicians are following trends and labels which make the part. Internationally, one of the world’s most beautiful luxury fashion labels, British brand Alexander McQueen is a master of its own craft. This then makes Alexander McQueen’s favourite pick and according to some style guru, this is how you can rock the dress: Embroidery comes in many guises, but floral details and intricate, detailed needlework. Don’t be afraid of a fully-embroidered look. Puffed sleeves are only getting bigger, which is great news for those of us fond of a bulky silhouette. Keep the rest of your look monochrome if you are opting for serious puff. The waist belt returned to our radar last season, with slim incarnations wrapped around just about every blazer we saw. Enjoy the weekend and make sure, you always sanitise, I repeat there is no more fashion statement better than that. — Tips courtesy of glamourmag. Feedback: tafadzwa.zimoyo@zimpapers.co.zw
