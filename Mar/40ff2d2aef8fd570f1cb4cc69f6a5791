The Tigers had, coming into the game, won the Peterhouse Songore tournament, the Petra tournament and the St John’s festival and were yet to lose in the league. Churchill coach, Tawanda Chitsindi, was thrilled with the result. “Last year, we were the first team to defeat them as well and, so, I think my boys came into the game knowing very well that such results can be achieved,’’ said Chitsindi. “The game was a tough one as we were playing in their backyard and they had the support but my boys stood their ground. “It is always difficult to predict, the team had a lot to prove and, for the first three quarters, they were leading us as they used their frames. “They have big boys and we were trailing for the better part of the game but due to endurance we beat them on speed in the final quarter. “The game was a close contest with shooting guard Munyaradzi Chidzomba managing to get us back in the game. “We are now focusing on the upcoming top school’s qualifiers set for March 28.” The Andrew Chitaura-coached Prince Edward side have a new crop of players, and they banked on shooting guard, Panashe Kaduya, who gave them a good platform.
