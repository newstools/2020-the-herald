MUTARE City Council are confident of completing the renovations of Sakubva before the domestic Premiership action gets underway. The stadium was condemned by the ZIFA First Instance Body two years ago and has not hosted any Premiership action since its ban. But the Mutare City Council have since moved up a gear in the renovation of the stadium. ‘‘The efforts to complete the outstanding renovations at Sakubva Stadium are progressing very well, with work being carried out day and night,” said Mutare Council spokesperson, Spren Mutiwi. “So far, we have completed about 50 percent work that was needed to be done on the stadium, expansion of the changing rooms and we are eyeing to finish work on the superstructure by the end of this week. “The contractor, working on the perimeter wall, is on site with the work also expected to be finished by the end of this week. “We are also mounting new gates and work on the turf is progressing well. It has been a hive of activity at the stadium.” Areas noted by the FIB, when the stadium was banned, included the replacement of the precast wall, which was vandalised by fans a few years ago, as well as the improvement of drainage and ablution  facilities. “We received additional funds from the Government and they have come as a major boost to our operations,’’ said Mutiwi. ‘‘We had been shouldering the burden on our own. ‘‘The financial assistance gave us some breathing space in our operations.’’ Mutare side Tenax will join Manica Diamonds in the top-flight league this season.
