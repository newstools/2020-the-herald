It’s a position of trust and responsibility and yes, I will do my best to fulfil the expectations of the party leadership and our membership. “There are seniors at the party to learn from.” Zanu PF Mashonaland West Youth League chairperson Cde Vengai Musengi hailed the appointment. He said it showed that Zanu PF had confidence in young blood. “We are happy because youths are now being given positions of trust,” said Cde Musengi.
