The Herald Forestry and saw milling firm,  Border Timbers, said yesterday exchange losses of up to $46,8 million  hit on its financial performance for the half year ending December 2019,  resulting in net profit slumping to $0,8 million from $3,1 million in  the comparative period the previous year. Border Timbers was placed under judicial management three years ago  after struggling to settle debts of around US$20 million. Trading in the company’s shares on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange was  subsequently suspended in November 2018. “Profit for the year is lower, mainly driven by unrealised exchange loss primarily from a foreign loan, the net unrealised exchange loss  amounts to $46 842 252,” judicial manager Mr Peter Bailey said in a  trading update. The decline in profitability is despite a huge jump in revenues, which amounted to $110,1 million compared to $12,6 million during the same  period the previous year on the back of an improvement in selling  prices. Lumber production, Mr Bailey said, was lower compared to the same period  the prior year as a result of power outages. “The low production had a knock-on effect on sales volume as this  resulted in lower sales compared to prior year, however, the improved  quality and value addition at our mills resulted in improved average  selling prices and better revenue,” he said. Treated poles also recorded a decline in both production and sales volume compared to same period prior year due to low demand. “Currently, there is increasing demand for our poles in the region and  an increase in both production and sales is anticipated in the next  quarter,” Mr Bailey said. He said the company would continue to focus on maximising value on its  biological assets, improving quality as well as increasing exports on  both lumber and poles. – New Ziana.
