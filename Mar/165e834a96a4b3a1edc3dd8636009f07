The Herald DHAKA. — When it comes to talent, there were never any doubts about Liton Das, who was highly rated even before making his international cricket debut in 2015. The questions surrounding him were always about consistency. The stylish wicketkeeper-batsman has all the shots in the book in his arsenal and, more importantly, when Liton gets going, it is a tough prospect for any opponent as the Sylhet International Cricket Stadium witnessed on Sunday. His masterclass against Zimbabwe in the first ODI was one of those days when the right-hander showed how a composed approach could help him find success. Liton smashed his second ODI hundred, which helped Bangladesh post their highest-ever total of 321 for six against Zimbabwe and eventually clinch a comprehensive 169-run win. However, the right-hander had to retire hurt after having cramps during the 37th over for a magnificent 105-ball 126 that featured 13 fours and three sixes. Liton was confident from the get-go and smote his first boundary with a cracking drive towards cover region to Chris Mpofu after Bangladesh had opted to bat. The highlight of Liton’s innings was the way he paced it, with a mixture of aggression and sensibility that was quite unlike him. The right-hander previously tended to throw away his wicket after getting set. The 25-year-old, who batted at number five in the World Cup, returned to his actual position and opened the innings. His maiden hundred had come batting at opening slot, against India in the final of the Asia Cup in 2018. — The Daily Star.
