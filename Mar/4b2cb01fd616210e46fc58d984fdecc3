DOMINICAN Convent coach Winston Nyanhete says he was impressed with the talent displayed at the fifth edition of the Clash of the Titans Inter-schools Karate championships on Saturday in Harare. The tournament attracted participants from different schools from Bulawayo and Kwekwe. Nyanhete said they had to reopen registration following a last-minute rush by some of the schools. “We ended up having last-minute entries. We had to reopen registration. So there were 30 schools with 142 athletes,’’ said Nyanhete. “The standard was very high, it has gone up. “Kwekwe High School brought a lot of talented athletes and they mostly dominated the boys events. “Simbarashe Mtekesa won gold in the boys Under-21 years kumite event. “Young Shawn Pote is back, he had an injury for the past two months. He is back now and he was one of the main highlights. “Tinashe Mbodza from Kambuzuma 2 Secondary, in the 16 to 17 years (age-group), was also another highlight of the day. He won one gold, one silver and one bronze. “Alexandra Mandengenda (Dominican Convent) won two gold medals making her the grand champion of the event while Nakai Mahachi won two gold medals in the 16 to 17 (age-group). “Dominican Convent School got five gold, four silver and seven bronze.’’ The tournament is organised and hosted by Dominican Convent. It was first held in 2015 and the number of schools participating has continued to increase over the years. It has also proved to be good platform for identification of young talented karatekas.
