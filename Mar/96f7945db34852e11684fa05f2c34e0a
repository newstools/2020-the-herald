The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — The Premier Soccer League looks set to resume despite the COVID-19 threat following a meeting between football leaders and Minister of Sport Nathi Mthethwa. SAFA and PSL bosses, Danny Jordaan and Irvin Khoza, along with other major sports federations, on Tuesday met with Mthethwa to resolve the challenges coronavirus has posed against football in the country. The PSL on Monday announced the suspension of all matches for this week in compliance with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s declaration of a national disaster over the increased spread of the deadly virus. However, following lengthy deliberations, the minister has since announced that the PSL will be allowed to resume with all matches under special circumstances. “It is not in two weeks or a week, it is now. We have said that, firstly we need the chairman and others in the leadership of sport to raise their voices against this pandemic,” said Mthethwa. “Therefore, they will continue with their matches, which will be without spectators, and they will finish the season. “The most important thing for us, as they do that, is they will be spreading the message to fight against this pandemic. “So, there is no confusion. Even if we are going to reach a point where there are no matches, that will be gradually phased in. “But as we speak, they can have their match tomorrow (Wednesday), with no spectators.” PSL general manager Lux September, however, has confirmed to KickOff.com that the final decision still rests with the Board of Governors, who are set to meet for an extraordinary meeting on Thursday, 19 March, meaning the decision to postpone midweek matches still stands. — Kick-Off.
