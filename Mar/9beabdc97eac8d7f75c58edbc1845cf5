The Herald MADRID. — Real Madrid’s victory in the Clasico gave them a one-point lead that might mean little in Spanish La Liga football’s error-strewn title race but whether it causes a decisive shift in momentum will be easier to read after this weekend. Barcelona host Real Sociedad today, an awkward fixture against a team that have won their last six consecutive matches and will still be flying high on the back of beating Mirandes on Wednesday to reach a first Copa del Rey final in 32 years. If Barca need to respond, Real Madrid have to prove their win at the Santiago Bernabeu can be the start of something more sustained, by overcoming Real Betis at the Benito Villamarin tomorrow. Spanish La Liga Fixtures Today: Eibar v Mallorca (2pm); Atletico Madrid v Sevilla (5pm); Barcelona v Real Sociedad (7:30pm); Getafe v Celta Vigo (10pm). Tomorrow: Osasuna v Espanyol (1pm); Real Valladolid v Athletic Bilbao (3pm); Levante v Granada (5pm); Villarreal v Leganes (7:30pm); Real Betis v Real Madrid (10pm). — AFP.
