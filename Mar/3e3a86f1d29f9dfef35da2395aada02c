ZIMBABWEAN professional golfer, Robson Chinhoi, has booked a place in the 2020 Magical Kenya Open to be held at the Caren Country Club in Nairobi from March 11-14. The big hitter will be the only local player in the European Tour co-sanctioned tournament. Chinhoi will be joined by Nigerian, Andrew Odoh, as the two regional players who qualified through the Safari Tour. The duo will be joined by seasoned Sunshine Tour campaigner, Toto Thimba, and Jayden Schaper, who will come via an invitation. Chinhoi, a member of Royal Harare, has represented Zimbabwe at amateur level and is now plying his trade on the East African Tour where he is making waves. He won the 2019 Castle Lite-sponsored Entebbe Golf Open in Uganda. Meanwhile, Chapman Golf Club will host the seventh edition of the annual JCI City Zimbabwe Golf Day where they will raise funds for Rupere Primary School in Seke. Daniel Chakacha, the JCI Zimbabwe trainer, said the funds to be raised will be channelled towards the establishment of a chicken project which will help the less-privileged members at the school. “Due to the tough economic environment, it has been difficult for some rural school-going kids to sustain themselves and that’s why we came up with the idea to host the fundraising tournament,” he said. “We just thought of the kids who are not able to sustain their school needs and came up with the idea to start a project which can be self-sustaining. ‘’We believe if we are able to raise funds for them, for a start, it would be easier for them to penetrate the lucrative chicken market,” Chakacha said.
