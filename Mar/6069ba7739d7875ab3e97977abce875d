Mr Munamato Mutevedzi has been appointed the substantive chief magistrate by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC). The post had been vacant since the resignation of Mr Mishrod Guvamombe in December last year. Mr Mutevedzi had been acting since the suspension of Mr Guvamombe who was facing charges of criminal abuse of office. The JSC interviewed five qualifying officers for the post and eventually selected Mr Mutevedzi, the JSC deputy secretary in charge of legal services and acting chief magistrate. JSC spokesperson Mr Brian Nkiwane confirmed the appointment. “Yes, I can confirm the development,” he said. “Mr Mutevedzi is the substantive chief magistrate. He assumes his new job on March 27.” Mr Guvamombe had initially been suspended when he appeared at the Harare regional magistrates court accused of recommending former ministers Saviour Kasukuwere and Supa Mandiwanzira for internship places at the Harare Magistrates Courts where they had pending criminal cases. The two were law students. Mr Guvamombe’s recommendation was said to be inconsistent with his duties. His criminal abuse of office charges collapsed after the State withdrew the case against him.
