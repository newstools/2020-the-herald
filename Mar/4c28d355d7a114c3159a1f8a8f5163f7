The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Fashion 263 Well, it is goodbye to the awards season in Zimbabwe as last week’s edition of the National Arts Merit Awards (NAMA) was the last. Not to compete with other awards held for the past season, as all of them have a same goal which is — appreciating the works of artistes. NAMA lived up to it’s billing — a great show it was, electrifying performances. The major highlight of the night was the fashion statement which others considered  to have taken over the entire show. Well, it is a fact that for awards to have sparks or fireworks everything starts from the red carpet. It was a first in the history of Zimbabwe to have a long red carpet of about 30 meters. It gave space to the fans who also had a fair chance to have their pictures taken from without squashing or squeezing each other. Then, the battle of who wore it better, who was the best dressed celebrities on red carpet began. The debate still continues on social media and somehow has already created camps. Let’s start with the women. Local designer Jasper Mandizera stole the limelight with the garment he designed for comedienne Madam Boss. It was a red dress with umbrella shoulders. This was a shocker and a surprise at the same time considering that we have not seen Madam Boss in such Lady Gaga design. This was furthermore alarming having been used to seeing Jasper playing with Netherlands based musician Vimbai Zimuto who is much controversial when it comes to fashion. Madam Boss pulled the look very well. Some of the socialites, celebrities that thronged the red carpet include Lee Madyara (Hollywood Lee), Tarisai Mukondo, Ammara Brown, Gemma Griffiths and Mbo Mohacs (co-host of the night). <img class="size-full wp-image-477129" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/macheso-freeman.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/macheso-freeman.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/macheso-freeman-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Freeman and Alick Macheso dressed by 4May International, shares as joke on the red carpet — Pictures courtesy of Tnash Photography and Sean Achando Not forgetting our own Minister of Sport, Arts and Recreation, Kirsty Coventry who wore a black and silver shining body hugging garment which matched her husband’s grey suit on the red carpet. To the gents, ok, move to the left. Alick Macheso pulled the suit look which gave him more confidence not only on the red carpet but also during his performances. Macheso wore a brown classical suit courtesy of popular leading men’s brand 4May International. Also leading the pack of best dressed men were Leroy Gopal, Freeman, Ti Gonzi, Ishan and Phatisani as always. Kudos goes to 4May International as it  is believed to have dressed over 27 male celebrities on the night, with most male winners shinning in their brand. It seems Zimbabweans are embracing the culture of fashion and are taking a step further to always look good at such events. I would say dressing for the red carpet is an art and well done to some of the celebrities. Too bad we had some who had the fashion disaster as they wore T-shirts and vests on the red carpet. I will not mention names but please, let us stick to the concept as preferred  by the organisers. A black tie event is just that. Now that the awards season is over, that does not mean there is no more need to dress up. That is a no, we have fashion weeks approaching and we say hello to the month of March. The month of March is dedicated to women and the commemorations begins tomorrow running under the theme, “Valiant Women of the Vote.” According to the gurus, the theme honours “the brave women who fought to win suffrage rights for women, and for the women who continue to fight for the voting rights of others.” We have our powerful women and they need to be celebrated this month. In the fashion industry, we have great names like Trish Carmen, Lillian Madyara, Cynthia Bizure Sithole and internationally we have Sarah Jessica Parker, Beyonce Knowles Carter and Tyra Banks among others who have revolutionalised the fashion movement and boy  — is it exciting! Women have changed the fashion industry and should be saluted. In fashion, models are the face behind the brand. The women who walk the runway have the power to inspire editors, buyers, and fashion lovers to covet a particular piece. Throughout history, they have defined —and defied — typical beauty standards, set new precedents, and popularised trends. In today’s world, the model has a greater voice and presence than ever. Think again of Grace Jones, Iman, Elle Macpherson and Cindy Crawford among others. <img class="size-full wp-image-477131" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/kirsty.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/kirsty.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/kirsty-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Coventry and husband Tyrone Seward Let us see what is in store this month as they celebrate themselves. Fashion pick of this week is the headband According to GlamourUK, when it comes to hair trends, you likely know that bleach blonde was huge in 2019 and that the “curtain fringe” is having a real moment right now. Socialite Kylie Jenner has made “golden brunette” the colour that everyone’s asking for, and all the cool girls of the world are rocking the modern mullet. But have you considered hair accessories as huge in the trending space? If not, you should totally focus your attention on the humble hair accessory. A survey conducted in the streets proved that headbands are trending. Whether you are into something subtle or one with bells and whistles, there are five trends dominating the headband arena right now that will thrill people from either end of the sartorial spectrum. Here is a quick guide from glamouruk that can help you 1: Satin WHY WE LOVE IT: Undoubtedly the chief headband trend right now, these are chic and fun but also fiercely flattering — adding a voluminous statement to even the most basic haircut. 2.  Embellishment WHY WE LOVE IT: Because it’s OTT. Duh. But also because it adds a serious zhush to even the most casual look, rendering getting ready for a fancy occasion a real breeze. 3. Wrap WHY WE LOVE IT: So Clueless. So 90s. Although rather than pushed back to the middle of your head, keep it modern by positioning it at the very front of your hairline. 4. Velvet WHY WE LOVE IT: Remember those velvet headbands with your name on that you were obsessed with a couple of decades ago? These may not (necessarily) be personalised, but they’re inciting serious nostalgia. 5. Do your own thing WHY WE LOVE IT: For the freedom. Plaited, feathered, or printed — this one’s for the braver headband warriors who don’t like to follow trends. (Apologies that we just dubbed this a trend in itself . . .)
