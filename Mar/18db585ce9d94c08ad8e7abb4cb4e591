The Herald Information for travellers
This information is for travellers who have been to countries or territories with confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19). As part of its efforts to strengthen Zimbabweâ€™s fight against the spread of COVID-19 from affected countries, the Government advises that as a country we continue to be guided by, and follow World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and advice on travel requirements. As such all travellers from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases are screened at ports of entry on arrival. Please note that travellers arriving from countries with local transmission of Covid-19 are in addition to being screened, advised to self-quarantine for 21-days. Self-quarantine means staying at home and avoiding situations that could facilitate the transmission of the coronavirus such as; Going to school or other crowded places Social gatherings and events where you may meet many people On arrival, travellers with signs and symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, shortness of breath) are immediately ferried to designated isolation centres (such as Wilkins Hospital) for further clinical management and assistance. Recommendations for travellers
Travellers from affected areas intending to come to Zimbabwe should delay or avoid travel if they have a febrile illness. We advise that travellers from countries with local transmission should subject themselves to clinical screening by their medical practitioner before they travel in order to get a medical certificate that indicates that they are clear of signs and symptoms of COVID-19. Equally, it is critical for ALL travellers to avoid unnecessary travels to and from countries with confirmed cases. All travellers are also advised to practice good personal hygiene including washing hands with soap and water frequently, covering the nose and mouth with tissue paper or flexed elbow when coughing and sneezing as well as follow proper food hygiene practices to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
