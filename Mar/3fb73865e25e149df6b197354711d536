ZIMBABWE’S prominent kart racer, Zac Dufty, will compete in the first round of the South Africa National Rok Championship next week in Cape Town. The race meeting is scheduled for March 20 and 21 in the Mother City. Dufty (16), who is the only non-South African competing in the championship, will be racing in the very powerful KZ class. He will be driving a kart that weighs 125kg and can reach speeds of over 140kph. Drivers at this championship include several world, national and regional champions. The weather is always a factor to contend with in Cape Town. Last year, heavy storms lashed the track but Dufty, racing in his previous class, took second place overall. This year in the KZ gearbox series, it will be very competitive but Dufty is determined to do his best and show what he can do. “I know I will have a lot to learn over the next few months in my rookie season in this class, but I’m ready and looking forward to the challenge,” Dufty told The Herald yesterday. Three weeks ago, at a race held at the South African Vereeniging Kart Club and in his first race in the KZ gearbox class, Dufty managed 14th place out of a grid of 25. “Qualifying saw a difference of only 1.1 seconds for all drivers, demonstrating how close the racing is in this series. “I’m very proud to be a member of RKT racing, one of the most successful karting teams in South Africa. “I was fortunate to start my South African racing career with them in 2013. I have raced with them in two world finals and competed in five different karting classes over the past seven years. “I’m also grateful to Motul in Zimbabwe who have supported me for the last four years,” Dufty said. Sadly, Dufty won’t be racing much in Zimbabwe this year due to budget constraints, but he is still busy locally by giving back to the sport he loves. Most weekends he can be found at Pole Position Karts in the Eastlea area of Harare training drivers.
