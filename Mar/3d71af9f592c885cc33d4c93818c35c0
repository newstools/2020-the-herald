The Zimbabwe Federation of Trade Unions (ZFTU) has urged people not to resort to confrontation, but help solve crises and disputes through engagement and dialogue. ZFTU secretary-general Mr Kennias Shamuyarira made these remarks during a Press conference in Harare yesterday. The call by the labour organisation comes after a recent spate of illegal demonstrations spearheaded by the opposition MDC-Alliance, with its Mr Nelson Chamisa refusing to join the Political Actors Dialogue (POLAD). “If all the available platforms for dialogue have been fully exhausted to no avail, targeted interventions should be engaged to specific elements causing economic hardships,” said Mr Shamuyarira. He said as labour representatives, their main issues were to curb cartels and corruption. “Corrupt elements in the economy should be incarcerated and our Judiciary should be seen to be taking action in killing the issue of corruption which is now a cancer in the country by arresting the culprits,” he said. “This is in line with our May Day themes since 2015 against cartels who are causing artificial shortages, benefiting themselves at the expense of the vulnerable citizens.” Mr Shamuyarira urged Government to address the erosion of wages and salaries under the Tripartite Negotiating Forum (TNF). He said the TNF technical committee had recommended to have a national minimum wage pegged at 50 percent of the Poverty Datum Line as at August 2018. “Government through its head of Government in the TNF had given a nod by suggesting an initial working proposal of 50 percent of 75 percent of the PDL as at August 2018,” Mr Shamuyarira said. “ZFTU strongly believe that all issues bedevilling our economy are to do with the fundamentals, mainly monetary, fiscal and inflation reduction.” Mr Shamuyarira said Government should urgently address currency issues.
