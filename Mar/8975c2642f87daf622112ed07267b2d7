THE country’s premier golf tournament, the Zimbabwe Open, has been confirmed this year after having disappeared from the radar, because of lack of sponsorship, last year. The tournament is scheduled for Royal Harare from March 30 to April 5. Pre-qualifiers will begin before the championship tournament starts from April 2. The Zimbabwe Open committee confirmed the developments, which will see local professionals, getting a chance to impress on the Sunshine Tour. The country now has, at most, just five professional golf players who are competing regularly on the Sunshine Tour due to lack of tour cards. The Sunshine Tour have since placed the Zimbabwe Open back on their calendar. The Zimbabwe Open was first played in 1984 and, from 1985 to 1992, it was part of the Safari circuit, a collection of events in Africa played by professionals based on the European Tour, during their winter break. When it was held, in the weeks preceding the Nedbank Golf Challenge, the tournament attracted some of the world’s leading players, as they used it as a warm-up to the big money invitational.
