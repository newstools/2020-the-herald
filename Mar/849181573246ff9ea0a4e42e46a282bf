The Herald LONDON. — A deflated Jose Mourinho admits his Tottenham team are in trouble, and will find it difficult to qualify for the Champions League football next season An injury-hit Tottenham were knocked out of the Champions League by RB Leipzig on Tuesday evening, losing 3-0 on the night in Germany and 4-0 on aggregate. They are currently seven points off the top four in the English Premier League, with an in-form Manchester United to come on Super Sunday at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and long-term injuries to key players in Harry Kane, Heung-Min Son, Steven Bergwijn to name just a few. Though Mourinho was optimistic about Spurs’ chances of overturning the 1-0 deficit from the first leg before the game, he admitted after that his side are finding it difficult at the moment. “The match I think of course the best team won. Physicality, intensity, counter-attack, winning duels, really strong team in the top of their condition, with their best players, a bench that has quality, against a team that is in trouble, you could see. I don’t need to repeat the same things again, we have lots of problems, and it is really, really difficult. “(On Monday) I was very positive, but that’s the way I have to be, and there is no point before the game not to believe, not to be motivated, optimistic, that is the way we sportsman have to be before every competition, but the reality is a different thing. One team in this moment is much stronger than we are. “This is difficult for me to speak again about injuries, but you want me to speak about other things, when it looks like the obvious is that the problems accumulate with the accumulation of injuries. If you want to make a mental exercise and imagine Leipzig tonight without Sabitzer, Schick, Werner, do you think they would win the way they did? “Do you want to go to Liverpool, without Salah, Mane, Henderson, Firmino? Do you want to go to Spain, to Barcelona without Griezmann, Messi, Suarez, Pique.  — Sky Sports.
