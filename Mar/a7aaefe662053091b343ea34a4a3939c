The Herald United States based Caledonia Mining  Corporation primary asset Blanket Mine produced a record 16 876 ounces  in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019 representing a 13 percent  increase from 14 952 ounces in the comparative period backed by improved  efficiencies. In a trading update, chief executive officer Steve Curtis said on-mine costs per ounce declined to $651 in 2019 from $690 in 2018 owing to  lower electricity costs in the first quarter and lower on-mine  administration costs due to the devaluation of the local currency. Despite continued substantial investment in the Central Shaft, the  company said cash flows remain strong. Cash flows from operating  activities increased 13 percent to US$23,9 million from US$21,1 million  in 2018. “This is largely on increased inventories (part of which relates to  increased stocks of diesel to protect against interruptions to the  electricity from the grid) and higher prepayments and lower payables, which reflect the reduced availability of supplier credit in Zimbabwe  due to the high level of inflation,” said Curtis. Capital investment for the year remained unchanged at US$20 million.  Central Shaft is poised to be commissioned by year end after which  production can begin to ramp up. Shaft sinking at Central Shaft was completed in July 2019 to the target depth of 1 204 meters. Target output in 2021 is estimated at 75 000oz and 80 000oz in 2022. “The shaft sinking phase of the project was completed in July 2019 and  work has commenced on equipping the shaft; the substantial capital  investment period is expected to be completed in the third quarter of  2020,” Curtis said, adding costs per ounce were expected to fall after  Central Shaft was commissioned. Curtis revealed that operating environment in the country had improved. “Although the country continues to face challenges, the introduction of  the interbank rate early in 2019 allowed us to better protect our  workers from the effects of high inflation,” he pointed. Interruptions to the supply of electricity from the grid which were  experienced in the half year, he said, had largely been addressed  following the conclusion of an agreement whereby Blanket and other gold  producers purchase power which is imported into the country. “This power is cheaper than under the previous arrangements prior to  the devaluation of the Zimbabwe currency and Blanket can manage the  reduced incidence of power interruptions using its increased suite of  diesel generators.” Apart from that, the miner is well-advanced in the evaluation of a  solar project to provide some of Blanket’s power supply and reduce its  dependence on imported power during daylight hours. Revenue went up 11 percent to US$75,82 million from US$68,39 million in  2018. After tax profit increased three-fold to US$50,4 million from US$13,75  million in 2018 backed by a net foreign exchange gain of about US$30  million. “This gain, which is largely unrealised, was due to the sharp  devaluation of the Zimbabwe currency from February 2019 onwards, which  reduced the US dollar values of bank loans and the deferred tax  liability. If exchange rates remain unchanged, these unrealised losses  will be realised from 2021 onwards as the deferred tax liability begins  to unwind and the term loans begin to fall due for payment,” added  Curtis. This year gold production is expected to range from 53 000oz to 56  000oz. — New Ziana.
