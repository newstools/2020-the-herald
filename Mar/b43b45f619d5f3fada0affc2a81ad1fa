PLATINUM Queens vice-captain, Progress Moyo, is confident they can challenge for honours in the Rainbow Amateur Netball League this season. Three rounds of matches have been played in the campaign. However, action has since been suspended in compliance with Government measures, which include the banning of gatherings of more than 100 people for two months, as the country battles against the coronavirus. Platinum Queens beat Goldreef and Lusumbami, in their first two games, and they have a game in hand. Although their second game, against Lusumbami, was not one of the best, Moyo said coming out as the best player on the day, was encouraging. “I am expecting to do my best for myself and my team. We know more tough games are coming, from the fifth to the eighth game we have Glow Petroleum, Ngezi, Correctional Queens and Beta,’’ said Moyo. “We are fighting for that (championship), it will be great to have a Player of the Year from our team and do better than last year. ‘’If we step up from now, we can also fight for the championship. I trust my team and, with the work rate we have, I think we are ready for anything.’’ The Platinum Queens goal attack is confident the work they have been putting in, during pre-season, will see them do well this campaign. But, she urged her teammates to keep on working hard. ‘’We started training from the 3rd of January, so I think we are ready. We just need to keep working to maintain that. “I don’t know about other teams but we are good for the fight,” said Moyo. Platinum Queens have been making progress in the league, finishing third in 2018, and second last year. And, hopefully, they can build on that when the league resumes. The Zvishavane-based side have some of the best players who include national team players like Claris Kwaramba and Tanaka Makusha. They also have the experience of captain Nomagugu Makhalima and Felisitus Kwangwa, who is on loan.
