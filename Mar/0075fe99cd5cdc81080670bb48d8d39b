The Herald President Donald Trump said last Thursday he welcomes the steep fall in crude oil prices caused by a tussle between Saudi Arabia and Russia, saying they are “like a tax cut” for American consumers. “Oil prices are at a point now that I would have dreamed about because the gasoline prices are going to be coming way down,” he told reporters in the White House. “So with gasoline prices coming down, that’s like a tax cut, that’s like a big tax cut,” he said. He said falling gas prices were good for consumers and likened the coronavirus to the common flu. “Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!” Trump wrote in one of a series of posts on Twitter. – AFP.
