China’s number of confirmed COVID-19 cases nears 81,000, with over 3,000 deaths. “As of now, for a week already no new cases of infection have been registered in any city of the Hubei province, except Wuhan. Seven new cases have been registered outside Hubei, six of which are imported. This means that the peak of the epidemic in the country is over in general,” Mi Feng said at a briefing.
