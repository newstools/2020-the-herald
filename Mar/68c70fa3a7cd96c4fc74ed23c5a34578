PREMIERSHIP newboys, Tennax and Whawha, have promised to pay their affiliation fees before the new deadline on Friday. Bulawayo City, the other team which was promoted last year, have also put their house in order. City are believed to have paid the affiliation fees at the end of last week, with the transfer expected to reflect in the PSL bank this week. The trio risked expulsion from the Castle Lager Premiership after the league, during their annual indaba on Friday, gave the teams a one-week deadline. Yesterday, Whawha chairman Watson Matara said they were confident they would keep their Premiership status after paying the $208 000 affiliation fees. “We should have all the finer details any time this week. I cannot disclose the name of the company which will sponsor us. But we will reveal everything. “We looked for sponsorship late and this affected our planning, but the good thing is we have secured it and I am very confident that we will make our payment well before deadline,” he said. Tennax chairman Stefani Masina said the Mutare side were looking for funds to pay their affiliation fees. “I am in Harare and something is being done. By Tuesday (today) we will have sorted it. “We are paying, we had some challenges and we wrote to the PSL,” he said. Apart from the affiliation issues, the annual meeting also resolved that the league will adopt a closer working relationship with the ZIFA Referees Committee. The league gate charges for this season have been pegged at $50 for the rest of the ground and $100 for fans wishing to sit in the VIP area. The fee will be effective from this weekend’s Castle Challenge Cup at Barbourfields in Bulawayo.
