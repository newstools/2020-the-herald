The Herald AUGUSTA. — With golf being put on hiatus right before the sport was about to kick into high gear, many fans are understandably disappointed. However, avoiding large crowds is key in helping prevent the spread of the coronavirus. On Monday, golf legend Tiger Woods had a message for all those fans on social media. In a tweet, Woods explained that golf isn’t high on the list of the world’s priorities right now. He just wants to make sure that everyone is safe and healthy before the sport resumes play. “There are a lot more important things in life than a golf tournament right now,” Woods tweeted. “We need to be safe, smart and do what is best for ourselves, our loved ones and our community.” The golf community is taking no chances with this infectious disease. When August National announced its decision to delay The Masters Tournament, Chairman of Augusta National Golf Club Fred Ripley addressed the issue of public health in part of his press release. “Considering the latest information and expert analysis, we have decided at this time to postpone the Masters Tournament, the Augusta National Women’s Amateur and the Drive, Chip and Putt National Finals. ‘’Ultimately, the health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision. — 247sport.com
