The Herald Low cost airline, Fastjet Zimbabwe said yesterday it will suspend operations at the end of the week for 21  days as part of measures to combat Covid-19. It becomes the latest airline to suspend flights into or from Zimbabwe,  after Emirates announced a similar move two weeks ago over Covid-19. Fastjet Zimbabwe said its last flights will be on Thursday. “Fastjet Zimbabwe announced today (Tuesday) that as a result of the  latest measures introduced in Zimbabwe and South Africa to control the  spread of COVID-19, all Fastjet flight operations shall be suspended  from Friday 27 March until Thursday 16 April 2020, both days fully  inclusive,” it said. It said it will offer free re-booking assistance to affected  passengers, and there will be no fare increase. “Further announcements and information will be shared via our website; Travel Update section and social media channels. Changes to the trading hours for our call centre and sales shops will be updated as and when  applicable.” Since commencing operations a few years ago, Fastjet Zimbabwe has flown  over 3,5 million passengers and curved out a niche as an affordable  low-cost carrier. Currently it runs 114 flights per week. In the first half of 2019, Fastjet Zimbabwe revenue rose 19 percent to  US$12,1 million from US$10,2 million in the comparative period, owing  largely to an increase in revenue per passenger and per available seat  kilometres.- New Ziana
