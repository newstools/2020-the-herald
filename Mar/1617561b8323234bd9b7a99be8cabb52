THE National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has started recruiting 291 prosecutors who will assist in the effective and expeditious prosecution of corruption cases. In February, Treasury unfroze recruitment and allowed NPA to recruit up to 291 prosecutors. The NPA recently advertised the prosecution vacancies, inviting qualified lawyers to submit their applications. “Career opportunities have arisen in the National Prosecuting Authority. The NPA invites applications from suitably qualified and experienced persons to fill vacancies that have arisen in the NPA. “The duties and responsibilities of the public prosecutors shall include, prosecution of criminal cases in the provincial and regional magistrates’ courts, providing legal advice to the police and other law enforcement agents in the investigation of criminal cases,” reads the advertisement. NPA spokesperson Ms Angela Munyeriwa said the recruitment was a major boost to the fight against corruption. “The 291 new prosecutors, if recruited, will enhance prosecution of corruption and other criminal cases,” she said. This comes at a time prosecutors seconded to the NPA by the uniformed forces were returning to their work stations in fulfilment of last year’s Constitutional Court ruling. According to the judgment in question, seconding uniformed forces to the prosecution department is unconstitutional. Prosecutor-General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi was given up to 24 months to disengage all serving members of the security forces.
