TWO of Zimbabwe’s top male and female distance runners, Jonathan Chinyoka and Olivia Chitate, powered to glory in the men and women’s sections of the CBZ Marathon in Harare yesterday. The 2020 edition of the CBZ Marathon attracted a huge field of 1 700 runners with athletes competing in the 5km, 10km and the main 42.2-kilometre categories. In the main marathon, it was Chinyoka (32) who claimed the pole position after setting a personal best time of 2 hours 18 minutes and 53seconds. He finished ahead of 23-year-old Prosper Mutwira who came home in 2hours 24 minutes and 06 seconds. Third place went to Tawanda Bvunzawabaya who clocked 2:27:58. Chinyoka, who won the 2020 Old Mutual Marathon on February 11, was excited to claim another victory within a month. “I am pleased with how things turned out because this is a personal best time for me. “I am now hoping that, with adequate support, I will be able to find sponsors to help me prepare for the Two Oceans and Comrades Marathon races,” Chinyoka said after yesterday’s race. The race started at Old Georgians Sports Club in Groombridge and ended at the same venue. One of South Africa’s top long-distance runners, Edward Muthibi, finished in fourth position. “I felt honoured to be invited to this marathon and bringing me here was a way to encourage the younger generations to take sport seriously because they can change people’s lives. “Last year I won the Comrades Marathon and it has changed my life and I now live a better life because of sport. “I was pleased with the turnout for this race because it shows that people are now taking physical health seriously,” said Muthibi after yesterday’s race. In the women’s race, seasoned female road runner Chitate (31) emerged triumphant in 2:50:14. She beat Faith Chisango (2:59:54) and Lizzie Chokore (3:06:37) into second and third places. The winners of both the women’s and men’s races walked away with $20 000 each while the second-placed athletes got $15 000 with the third-placed athletes getting $10 000. Hatihwande Nyamande and Chiedza Chokori won the men’s and women’s veterans category with “old war-horse” Nicholas Nyengerai (59) winning the Grandmaster event for men in 2:58:16. Dorothy Graham was the first to cross the finish line in the women’s section in 4:38:32. There was also joy for 25-year-old Ebel Chibanda, who won the men’s 21.1km race in 1:04:13, beating Moses Tarakinyu (1:04:16) and Mike Avota (1:23:57). The top three places in the women’s 21.1km race went to Patience Murowe (1:19:43), Miriam Sibanda (1:19:48) and Melody Chikonzi (1:31:29). Meanwhile, 10-year-old Anesuishe Paradza surprised all and sundry at yesterday’s event when he won the men’s 5km race in 29 minutes and 05 seconds. He was equally shocked with his win after he raced with senior athletes aged 22 and 25. “It was very nice to win the race, I just came into the race focused on running but I ended up winning the race and I am so honoured,” said Paradza. The silver medal in the men’s 5km race went to 25-year-old Anthony Mukuwamombe (29:35) while Christopher Ngoshi settled for third place in 32 minutes 42 seconds.  The Harare athletics Board hailed the CBZ Group Holdings for staging a successful marathon. “I can say, from a personal point of view, that the race was well organised and the event has grown. “It’s now more like the Victoria Falls Marathon because it’s n ow recording a huge turn up of athletes. “The competition is becoming more competitive, which is great for athletes, because it can give them international recognition. “We recorded about 1 700 athletes for the event this year and the winners were awarded huge sums of money, the winners walked away with $20 000,” said HAB chairman Pheneas Zinhiva. CBZ Group Holdings chief executive, Blessing Mudavanhu, also hailed the huge turnout of athletes. “This year was much bigger than last year and our objective is to get people exercise and also create a platform where families can enjoy together. “This year’s event was also special because we had the 2019 Comrades Marathon winner with us and also we used it to launch our new brand which we are going to make bigger next year,” said Mudavanhu.
