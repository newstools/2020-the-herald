The Herald Davison Bhunu Sports Reporter HARARE City Council, in partnership with JM Busha54 races, are set to host a cycling event dubbed “Harare Cycling Hour” in the capital today. The event, running under the theme ‘‘Creating a cycling culture, safe cycling space and a greener Sunshine City’’, will be held to promote cycling in Harare. The event will start at 8:30am, opposite Meikles Hotel, alongside Jason Moyo Avenue. The council will be partnering JM Busha54, who have over the past held cycling events in the capital, and are also aiming to create peace through sport in the SADC region. “The world bicycle industry is projected to be worth $75 billion by 2025, this is because bicycles can be used as a principal means of transport and provides recreation,’’ said JM Busha 54 Races executive director Pamela Makanjera. “They can also be used for fitness, bicycle racing and can also be used to replace the much used road transport so as to avoid congestion and toxicity of the air by engine vehicles that populate the city. “In a nutshell, bicycles are the future for any progressive world-class city. “The cycling event will also be aimed at creating opportunities for resuscitating the bicycle manufacturing industry which has massive growth opportunities. “The event will be held with the aim to show the importance of resuscitating the cycling infrastructure and creation of safe cycling spaces within the city.’’ The event is open to all cyclists with a number of top officials expected to take part. All types of bicycles are welcome at the event, with the hosts encouraging cyclists to attend the event with their helmets. Last year JM Busha54 hosted a similar cycling event, which attracted about 100 cyclists, at the same venue.
