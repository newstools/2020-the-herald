THE meeting scheduled for Saturday last week between Vice President Kembo Mohadi and Zexcom Foundation Investment Fund committee members was postponed until further notice. Zexcom Investment Fund Limited has been under judicial management since 2001. The scheduled meeting was meant to put the investment vehicle in order. Zexcom board chairman Cde Jonah Gumo said the meeting had been cancelled due to the fight against the spread of Covid-19. Cde Gumo said the intervention of VP Mohadi was expected to resolve the impasse in the running of the affairs of the organisation. In a statement, Zexcom said the postponement of the meeting was in line with the declaration of the measures by President Mnangagwa to minimise the spread of Covid-19. “Putting Zexcom’s house in order is part of President Mnangagwa’s broader vision of assisting war veterans’ business and properties and charting a progressive way forward for such entities,” said Zexcom. Properties that were acquired by war veterans under the Zimbabwe Ex-Combatants (Zexcom) Foundation Investment Fund should be relooked into and measures put in place to ensure they benefit the former freedom fighters, said the organisation.
