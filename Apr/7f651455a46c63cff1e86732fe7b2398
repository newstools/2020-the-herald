The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Lifestyle Reporter Many children’s favourite programmes on television revolve around cartoons. They follow superheroes or fairytale love stories to an extent  that some will grow to idolise cartoon heroes, with some even carrying namesakes of their imagined heroes. Some who are not fond of cartoons spend most of their time playing with toys. Boys play with guns, while girls play with dolls. Most people, if not everyone, passed through the playhouse game. But there is a case of one artist whose story is different as he neither liked cartoons, toys or playhouses while growing up. His best friend was a pencil and surprisingly while others watched cartoons, he would almost always switch to channels showing documentaries that have to do with wildlife. This is interesting at such an age — watching snake hissing, crawling slowly in the grass, tigers and lions roaring and elephants trumpeting. Born 23 years ago in Chitungwiza, in a family of two, Ricky Dampers said his best friend is a pencil besides the love of wildlife. He would draw his jungle and play with it. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484252" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/art2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/art2.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/art2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> To date, Dampers has drawn wildlife images that have stunned, especially the white community and tourists on social media and his images have gone viral across Africa. “When I was in Grade Four, I enjoyed wildlife films and documentaries,” he said. “I used to watch wildlife documentaries on National Geography World channel and people would wonder what had gone wrong in my head. “I chose to focus on wildlife because it was a calling at a tender age, I just find myself drawing wildlife animals because of what I saw on the documentaries and I love drawing animal faces as I want to bring out the beauty of our wildlife. “I use a lot of equipment to create my work, for example blending stumps, tom-bow mono zero erasers, cotton buds and charcoal pencils. I love using charcoal pencils as it allows me to create many different animals’ textures. “For my drawing duration, it depends with the size of paper and amount of details. For an A4 piece it usually takes me two days, but for a big piece it can take seven to eight days to finish.” Dampers, who is currently enrolled at the Chinhoyi University of Technology studying Industrial Designing, is already getting jobs from different wildlife companies across Africa. “Right now I am working with many animal organisations on wildlife conservation campaigns,” he said. “My role model is Kelvin Okafor from Nigeria, he is an amazing artist. I just like the way he polishes up his work and humbleness. “Okafor has done a lot in the art industry internationally and it is my wish to follow in his footsteps.” Though Dampers is a ghetto boy, growing up in the suburb of Glen Norah, he said this does not stop him chasing his dream. He said art sustains livelihoods if taken seriously. “I love the leopard,” said Dampers. <img class="size-full wp-image-484254" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/art3.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/art3.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/art3-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> A client shows a painting that he bought from Ricky Dampers “I see myself making a living through art. I used to think it was impossible until I decided to be more serious about my work and it has started to change. As of now, I am able to cover all my college expenses be it school fees, accommodation and other stuff. “I sell my work locally and internationally. Currently, I attend group exhibitions, internationally my social media handles the sale of my work abroad.” Dampers said he has lost count of the drawings he has done so far, but one portrait that he cherishes the most is that of his girlfriend. “She was so excited,” said Dampers. “I don’t usually draw people or celebrities as I am not a human portraiture artist. I am more of a wildlife artist. “I usually get enquires from all over, but my main focus is animals. “However, my greatest artwork was a close up of a leopard and it was bought by Barb Selby Forb from Australia.” Dampers has hosted exhibitions at Moto Republic in Belgravia, The Space in Ballantyne Park, Borrowdale Brooke Golf Club and Alo Alo restaurant in Arundel Village, with the highest bidder buying it for US$1 000. “My parents were against art,” he said. “They wanted me to focus on my academics, but that did not stop me from pursuing my interest in art. The criticism pushed me further ahead and here I am. Now, my parents are happy and proud, in fact I have done a piece dedicated to them.” Dampers said he is different from other youths, as he spends his life indoors busy with art works. He later cited challenges of lack of appreciation and support that has hindered the industry. “I don’t have social life as I am busy in my studio drawing,” said Dampers. “To be honest sometimes I fail to balance art and social life. My room is both an art studio and bedroom, I have created some divisions. “The challenge I am facing now is that in Zimbabwe we lack raw materials to use and also because of the economic situation many people can’t afford to buy artworks. The appreciation and support here is worrisome.” Apart from drawing, Dampers is also a good cook.
