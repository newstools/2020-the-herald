The Herald Arts Reporter Readers have expressed mixed feelings over Kenyan musician, Pastor Antony Musembi’s move to do a rendition of Oliver Mtukudzi’s song “Todii” without permission. Following our story yesterday about the legal engagement between Tuku Music and Musembi over the rendition, readers expressed their feelings over the issue on our social media pages. Musembi did a rendition of “Todii” for his Covid-19 awareness song that was released last Saturday  and Tuku Music revealed the Kenyan had not sought permission to do so. The two parties are working towards and amicable settlement. Readers aired their views, with the majority castigating Musembi for copyright infringement. However, others felt the song was for a good cause and Tuku Music should be lenient with him. “That’s downright disrespect and shows how Africans treat each other. I am sure if he had used Dolly Parton’s song he was going to seek the necessary permission,” noted Murah Regalo Pablo on Facebook. Another reader, Mickey Vasco Matsikiti concurred with Pablo, but urged local authorities to be also hard on such cases that are also prevalent among local musicians. “Very good (point made by Pablo), but before we travel to Kenya then let’s start arresting our own artiste doing the very same thing. “I am sure we will put a hand full of them behind bars,” noted Matsikiti. He also suggested that such attention should be given to people that are pirating music for sale on streets. Stewart Muchapera believes Tuku Music should pardon the musician. “We have seen many renditions of Tuku, and people have applauded them, and Tuku Music, has remained quiet, handifungi kuti SaManyanga dai vari vapenyu vaiita hangy’a nazvo (I don’t think if Tuku was alive he would have cared about it),” noted Muchapera. Most of the commentators on Twitter urged Musembi to observe copyright law and follow correct procedures for recording renditions.
