The Herald LONDON. — The postponement of the 2020 Tokyo Games means the International Olympic Committee will have to shoulder “several hundred million dollars” of costs, its president Thomas Bach has admitted.
An open letter from Bach to the Olympic movement outlined the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on sport and wider society. The leaders of the Tokyo organising committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games have warned the costs of delaying the Games until the summer of 2021 will be massive, with media reports in Japan putting the additional cost somewhere between two and six billion US dollars. Bach said: “Although it is too early to give an exact figure, we already know that we have to shoulder several hundred million US dollars of postponement costs. “This is why we also need to look into and review all the services that we provide for these postponed Games.” Bach acknowledged the impact of the postponement at National Olympic Committee (NOC) level as well.’’ — Sky Sports
