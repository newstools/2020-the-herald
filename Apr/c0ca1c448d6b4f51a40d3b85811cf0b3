The Herald European shares headed lower yesterday after a five-day rally as the first batch of earnings reports underlined the business damage from the coronavirus pandemic, while energy stocks sank on worries of a plunge in oil demand. Declines for Total SA, Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc sent the European energy index .SXEP to its lowest this month as dire forecasts of the worst economic slump since the Great Depression hit oil prices. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 1,6 percent, after surging almost 8 percent  since April 6 on early signs the health crisis was ebbing and on hopes that sweeping lockdown measures would soon be lifted. The benchmark index has recovered about 22 percent since hitting an eight-year low in March, but is still down about 24 percent from its record high and analysts warned an uptick in coronavirus cases could spark another sell-off. “With the market outlook still mired in tremendous uncertainty, gains in equities remain far from a one-way bet,” said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM. “Lingering fears over the coronavirus could well put a lid on consumption and alter spending habits, while leaving corporate earnings stunted for an extended period.” US majors JPMorgan Chase & Co and Johnson and Johnson kicked off the first-quarter earnings season on Tuesday with glum forecasts for 2020 as the pandemic crushed business activity and erased liquidity. — Reuters.
