The Herald The Government has designated tobacco buyers and sellers and staff at auction floors as providers of essential service and therefore exempted from the Covid-19 lockdown. The country has been placed in lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, but has made exemptions for people working in key industries and services. But in Statutory Instrument 94 of 2020 Public Health, the Government still imposed restrictions on the buyers and sellers, stipulating that they shall not remain on site for longer than is needed to complete the transactions for which they assembled. “When an order designating a tobacco auction floor is made, the Minister responsible for agriculture shall cause notice of the effect of such order to be given as soon as may be in such manner as he or she thinks necessary for bringing it to the attention of all persons who, in his or her opinion, ought to have notice thereof,” the Government
said. “An order designating a tobacco auction floors shall have effect immediately upon the making thereof.”
In light of Covid-19, the opening of this year’s tobacco marketing season has been delayed to allow precautionary measures to be taken against the spread of the pandemic. — New Ziana.
