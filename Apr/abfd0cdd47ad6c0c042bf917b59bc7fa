The Herald ZIFA have received the report concerning preliminary inspections done on the National Sports and Barbourfields in March. The report further confirms that the two facilities do not meet minimum standards expected by FIFA and CAF to host Warriors’ matches. Both stadia are still barred from hosting senior men’s competitions, but they are approved to host youth and women’s competitions. The inspection done in March was meant to provide ZIFA and stadium authorities with guidelines on areas that require attention before the final round of inspections scheduled for June and July 2020. Government and Bulawayo City Council have been notified of the recommendations made by CAF inspectors, and the urgent need to attend to issues raised cannot be further emphasised. If work on recommendations is complete, ZIFA will invite CAF to conduct another inspection between 15 June and 20 July to determine whether or not we can play senior men’s competitions at home. Our local stadium inspection team, the First Instance Body will conduct weekly inspections to ensure that refurbishments at National Sports  and Barbourfields Stadiums are in line with the expectations of CAF and FIFA. We appeal to all stakeholders involved to expedite the process of upgrading our facilities to the required standard so that we avert the grim possibility of playing our home matches abroad. In this time of the Covid-19 pandemic, we encourage everyone to observe recommended healthy habits regarding staying safe while also combating the spread of the deadly virus. — Zifa.org.
