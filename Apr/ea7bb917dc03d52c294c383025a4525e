The Herald Herald Correspondent A GROUP of 60 Mbare residents on Tuesday broke into Mupedzanhamo flea market and looted tents and wooden pallets after receiving fake news that council and police intended to demolish the structure. The residents, who were mainly from Nenyere Flats, stampeded the market, grabbing wooden pallets, tents and other valuables belonging to traders. This happened when most of the traders were at their homes in different suburbs. Police and the army swiftly reacted and dispersed the residents. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the residents dropped their loot when the security forces arrived. “Some 60 people broke into Mupedzanhamo Market to loot goods while acting on false information that law enforcement agents were planning to demolish structures there,” he said. “They started removing tents and wooden pallets but police and ZNA officers reacted and managed to disperse them. Nothing was taken away.” In Masvingo, a group of residents stormed Manyame business centre and ordered the opening of one bottle store in violation of the lockdown directive. Asst Comm Nyathi said 30 people were found drinking beer in the bottle store. “When police were called in, the gang members threw stones at officers, who managed to disperse them,” he said. Police urged people to stay in their houses and maintain social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19.
