The Herald SYDNEY. — Australian cricketers “sucked up” to India and Virat Kohli by holding back on verbal sledging to protect lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) deals, according to former Australia captain Michael Clarke. Clarke said players were “too scared” to play a normal game against India because of the influence of the world’s wealthiest cricket tournament. “Everybody knows how powerful India are in regards to the financial part of the game, internationally or domestically with the IPL,” Clarke said on Sky Racing television. “I feel that Australian cricket, and probably every other team over a little period, went the opposite and actually sucked up to India. “They were too scared to sledge Kohli or the other Indian players,” he said, referring to the verbal sparring that often takes place on the pitch. Australian players have attracted big money since the IPL started in 2008. Paceman Pat Cummins is the most expensive overseas star this year with Kolkata Knight Riders paying US$2,17 million. The contest has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic and the league must announce soon whether it will be held at all. — AFP.
