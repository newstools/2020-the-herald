The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal’s players will be allowed to return to train at London Colney from this week while Aston Villa’s squad have agreed a 25 per cent wage deferral as Chelsea decide against a pay cut. Arsenal are set to become the first professional club in the UK to return to training despite the UK being placed under strict lockdown conditions. Specific regulations are being put in place at their Colney complex to facilitate first team players. It is claimed no buildings will be opened and players must train individually in accordance with government guidelines. Arsenal was one of the first clubs to be hit hard by the coronavirus as head coach Mikel Arteta tested positive while the season was still ongoing. That was a major catalyst to the campaign being suspended on March 9. There are hopes top-flight football will resume in June and Arsenal are looking to jump the gun by offering their players the opportunity to train within days. The Gunners’ squad will undertake some light running individually in line with the government’s coronavirus regulations. A club spokesperson confirmed: “Players will be permitted access to our London Colney training grounds this coming week. Access will be limited, carefully managed and social distancing will be maintained at all times. All Colney buildings remain closed. Players will travel alone, do their individual workout and return home.” Players will reportedly operate on a strict rotational basis, with small groups arriving individually and they will not come into contact with each other. It comes after Alexandre Lacazette, David Luiz, Nicolas Pepe and Granit Xhaka were all reminded about their responsibilities after being photographed violating coronavirus guidelines recently. Luiz and Xhaka were seen meeting up in a park in north London, a video emerged of Pepe playing football with his friends. — Metro.
