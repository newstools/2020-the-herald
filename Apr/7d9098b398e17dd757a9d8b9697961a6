The Herald Tendai Rupapa, Senior Reporter FIRST Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa has, through her Angel of Hope Foundation, provided a potable bathroom, toilet and sanitiser for the Ruwa family which has four members who have tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19). Five of the Sakudya family members tested negative and there were fears the whole family would be infected since they were using the same facilities. The pandemic has so far killed two people in Zimbabwe. The First Lady is the country’s health ambassador and a philanthropist. The First Lady said the donation was part of her efforts to prevent the spread of the virus. “As a mother, I always want to ensure that everyone is safe. I read in the newspapers that the family members were using the same toilet and bathroom. The provision of the portable toilet and bathroom will ensure those who are infected will not share the same facilities with those who are negative,” she said.
