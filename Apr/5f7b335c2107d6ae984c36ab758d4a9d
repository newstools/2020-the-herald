The Herald JOHJANNESBURG  —  Legendary former Springbok centre Danie Gerber says he suffered severe body aches while recovering from the coronavirus. Gerber revealed over the weekend that he had recovered from the dreaded Covid-19 disease. However, in an interview with Netwerk24, Gerber said having the illness was no joke. ‘‘I couldn’t even touch my body with my finger. It was extremely sore. Each person has their own symptoms, each person’s body is different. Initially we heard sore throat, dry cough, fever and headaches were symptoms. But it’s not necessarily all these things together,” he stressed. Gerber, who turned 62 last Tuesday, tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after attending a golf day in late March along with a number of other former Springboks in Jan Kempdorp. At least four others in attendance – Divan Serfontein, Colin Beck, Burger Geldenhuys and Robbie Blair – also tested positive for the virus, but have subsequently been given the all-clear. Gerber said in his case he developed a high fever to go with the extreme body aches. “Colin (Beck), on the other hand, had a severe headache. He said the pain was so bad that it felt like he was getting a stroke.” Gerber’s daughter Elanie (36) and wife Elsabe (59) also contracted the disease, with his daughter having since also recovered. — Sport24.
