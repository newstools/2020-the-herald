The Herald Herald Reporter The Hindoo Society yesterday fulfilled its promise to President Mnangagwa to make further donations to medical institutions when it handed over refrigerators, buckets and bin liners to five public health institutions in Harare. The five institutions are Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Chitungwiza Central Hospital, Wilkins and Beatrice Road Infectious Disease Hospitals. Dr Pria Pakkiri, who handed over the donation, said they were expecting to deliver a consignment of personal protective equipment. Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said Government was “impressed and encouraged” by the continuous support. She said Zimbabwe had greater chances of winning the war against Covid-19 if it continued to receive support from the private sector and individuals. “There is a greater impact if we respond to Covid-19 as a group,” said Minister Mutsvangwa. “Covid-19 is not a Government problem alone, it is a problem for all of us in the country.” Health and Child Care Minister Dr Obadiah Moyo said the refrigerators would be used to stock medicines at the five central hospitals. “While more focus has been on PPE, this is also an unrealised priority, which is essential in storage of our medicines,” he said.
