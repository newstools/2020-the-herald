The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Court Reporter A police officer stationed at ZRP Chinamhora in Domboshava has appeared in court facing rape charges after helping a colleague to rape a teenage girl they found with her boyfriend in the bush. Senior Kumadzi (34) was not asked to plead when he appeared before magistrate Ms Barbra Maketo. State counsel Mr Lancelot Mutsokoti alleges that on March 20 this year around 6pm, Kumadzi and Nomore Gotora found the teenager and her boyfriend on Maro Mountain. Kumadzi allegedly fetched his handcuffs and ordered the 17-year-old and her friend to undress, handcuffed them together and took their clothes, threatening to show them to her parents. Kumadzi allegedly asked the two to be intimate while they watched, but they refused. He then walked away with the girlâ€™s clothes before returning with Gotora, who is still on the run. They removed the handcuffs and asked the boy to leave. Gotora then made sexual advances towards the girl, but was turned down. He allegedly raped the girl, while Kumadzi stood guard. After the assault, Gotora left Kumadzi and the girl. Kumadzi is said to have escorted the girl to her homestead and asked for her contact number, so that the two officers could send her money to conceal the assault. But she reported the assault and Kumadzi was arrested, while Gotora is still being hunted.
