The Herald Bill Withers, the acclaimed 1970s soul singer behind hits “Ain’t No Sunshine” and “Lean On Me” has died from heart complications aged 81, his family said. The singer died last Monday in Los Angeles, the family told the Associated Press. They described him in a statement as a “solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world”. “He spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other,” the statement said. Known for his smooth baritone vocals and sumptuous soul arrangements, he wrote some of the 70s best-remembered songs, including “Just The Two Of Us”, “Lovely Day” and “Use Me.” Although he stopped recording in 1985, his songs remained a major influence on R&B and hip-hop. His track “Grandma’s Hands” was sampled on Blackstreet’s “No Diggity”, and Eminem reinterpreted “Just The Two Of Us” on his hit 1997 Bonnie And Clyde. “We are devastated by the loss of our beloved, devoted husband and father,” said his family. “With his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other. “As private a life as he lived, close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world. In this difficult time, we pray his music offers comfort and entertainment as fans hold tight to loved ones.” The star’s signature song “Lean On Me” has recently become associated with the Coronavirus pandemic, with many people posting their own versions to support health workers and other essential services. Born in 1938, Withers was the youngest of six children. His father died when he was a child and he was raised by his mother and grandmother. – bbcworld.
