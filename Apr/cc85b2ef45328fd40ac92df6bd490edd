A Harare businessman appeared in court on Tuesday after 18kg of mbanje with a street value of about $15 000 was found in the boot of his car, which he has suggested was planted by a rival. According to the State, the mbanje was stashed in his vehicle’s boot and the police intercepted him in Budiriro following a tip-off. Elliot Kariyana (45) appeared before magistrate Mr Richard Ramaboa charged with unlawful possession of mbanje. He was released on $1 000 bail after his lawyer, Mr Knowledge Maeresera of Chizengeya, Maeresera and Chikumba Legal Practitioners, successfully applied for bail. Mr Maeresera argued that his client was not a flight risk as he was a family man with two wives and 10 children and owned a trucking business. “The mere fact that the dagga was found in his car boot does not mean he knew or intended to possess it. Police were informed by someone who is not mentioned and could have planted the dagga,” he said. “Anyone can do anything to get my client out of business.” Prosecutor Mr Lawrence Gangarahwe had opposed bail on the basis that the State had a strong case against Kariyana, who was likely to go to jail if convicted. “The accused person was caught red-handed, thus cutting away the presumption of innocence,” he said. “He is also facing a serious offence and is likely to face a prison term if convicted, hence this will induce him to abscond. He is not a suitable candidate for  bail.” After hearing submissions from both parties, the court ruled in favour of the defence and granted Kariyana bail on the basis that seriousness of an offence on its own was not sufficient grounds for denying an accused bail. Mr Ramaboa ordered Kariyana to report once a week to the police and not to interfere with investigations.
