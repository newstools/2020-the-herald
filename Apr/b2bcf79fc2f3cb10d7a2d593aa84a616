The Herald Africa Moyo Deputy News Editor The Zanu PF Youth League is happy with the roles some of its members are playing in economic development, but wants the deployees to shun corruption and serve the country’s interests, Acting Deputy Secretary for Youth Cde Tendai Chirau has said. He said this in the Youth League’s 40th Independence Day celebrations, under the theme, “Defining a decade towards 2030”. Cde Chirau said as youths join President Mnangagwa and Zimbabweans in celebrating the important day, they remain alive to the fact that it came at a painful cost following years of a protracted struggle by youthful patriots, both departed and still living. <img class="wp-image-409233 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/2712-1-1-PETER-HARITATOS.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="381" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/2712-1-1-PETER-HARITATOS.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/2712-1-1-PETER-HARITATOS-360x202.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Deputy Minister Vangelis Haritatos “Our national history of struggle, from the First Chimurenga, through the Second Chimurenga, and even up until now, has always been a story of young people drawing lessons from their elders and applying the wisdom towards defining their future,” he said. <img class="wp-image-409166 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/Jah-prayzah.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/Jah-prayzah.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/Jah-prayzah-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Cde Tinoda Machakaire with Jah Prayzah (File picture) “Generational blending has been the mainstay of our enduring revolution, strengthening the legacy of commitment in defence of our sacrosanct heritage, from which we draw inspiration. “We are indeed honoured as young people to have the opportunity to play our own part in this continuing revolution during our time, particularly as we are priviledged to have most of the veteran cadres of the liberation struggle still alive and with us, as they pass the legacy to younger generations.” <img class="wp-image-457025 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/0511-1-1-JENFAN-MUSWERE.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/0511-1-1-JENFAN-MUSWERE.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/0511-1-1-JENFAN-MUSWERE-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Muswere He said Vision 2030, of an upper middle income society, was a fitting example of Zimbabwe’s enduring struggle, as it shapes its discourse for the future. Young people say they fearlessly accept their mandate as a generation, to spearhead economic growth, working hand in glove with their leaders. The youths’ desired economic trajectory is one that aims for broad-based, inclusive prosperity for Zimbabwe. For this to be achieved, it is felt that youths should be the owners of resources and means of production. Cde Chirau said it was equally important that those owning resources should be honest, creative and productive. “Failure to produce on land is a betrayal of the revolutionary legacy bequeathed to us by the nationalist generation. <img class="wp-image-465090 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/2412-1-1-MIN-KIRSTY-COVENTRY.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/2412-1-1-MIN-KIRSTY-COVENTRY.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/2412-1-1-MIN-KIRSTY-COVENTRY-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Kirsty Coventry “The Second Republic challenges all youths to be innovative and productive. This new dispensation brought with it numerous opportunities for young people to contribute towards national growth through innovation hubs,” he said. President Mnangagwa’s administration has deliberately supported youths, with a number of them such as Vangelis Haritatos, Kirsty Coventry, Dr Jenfan Muswere, Tinoda Machakaire and Mangaliso Ndlovu, being appointed ministers or deputy ministers. <img class="wp-image-438038 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/06/2806-1-1-MANGALISO-NDLOVU-1.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/06/2806-1-1-MANGALISO-NDLOVU-1.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/06/2806-1-1-MANGALISO-NDLOVU-1-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Minister Ndlovu He said it was unfortunate that this year’s independence celebrations come amidst a unique test of national character, as Zimbabwe battles to combat the deadly coronavirus, “which has no respect for colour, class, creed or affiliation.” He saluted patriots who have thus far, stood tall in fighting the invisible global enemy from the frontline, especially medical personnel who are risking their lives to save others.
