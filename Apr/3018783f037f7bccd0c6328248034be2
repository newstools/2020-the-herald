FOUR CAPS United players, who were dropped from the final squad for the first half of the pending 2020 Premiership season, have failed in their bid to join Herentals. All other top-flight clubs, except the Students, have registered their squads with the PSL, whose deadline was March 31. Herentals have a pending case before the ZIFA Appeals Committee and, should they be cleared, they will be allowed to register their players. Former CAPS United captain, Valentine Musarurwa, Kudzi Nyamupfukudza, Clive Rupiya and Tinashe Balakasi were dropped from the Green Machine squad though they remain on the team’s books. They had hoped to secure a loan move to Herentals but The Students have indicated they won’t be adding any players to their list. Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva yesterday said his team was intact and he won’t be adding any more players. “Once we are cleared by the ZIFA Appeals Committee, we won’t have any time, we will have to register our squad with the Premier Soccer League straight away,” said Mutiwekuziva. “We have a strong team at our disposal and we are not adding any players to the list I already have. “Look, we have a lot of loyal youngsters who were with us and who chose to be with us even at a time everything seemed not to be working well for us. “Those are the players we consider to have the team at heart and some of them are good enough and other teams in the league wanted to sign them but they refused, opting to stay with us.’’ The CAPS United players will not have any choice but to play for ZIFA Northern Region Division One side Black Mambas this coming season if Mutiwekuziva doesn’t change his stance. Meanwhile, ex-CAPS United player, Pride Zivengwa, who failed to join Dynamos, is still hopeful he will secure a contract with the Students.
