The Herald Herald Reporter THE Association of Healthcare Funders of Zimbabwe (AHFoZ) yesterday donated personal protective equipment (PPE) worth $1 649 804 to the Ministry of Health and Child Care. AHFoZ is the umbrella body for medical aid societies in Zimbabwe. The items donated included a total of 4 070 N95 and 3 ply masks, 33 200 latex gloves, 200 goggles, 20 000 alcohol swabs and 10 litres of anti-bacterial soap. Speaking during the handover ceremony, AHFoZ chief executive Mrs Shylet Sanyanga said her organisation realised that fighting Covid-19 was not a Government responsibility alone. “AHFoZ members are conscious of the fact they are in the business of health, and they do realise that the battle against Covid-19 is not for the Government alone,” she said. “As such, AHFoZ has mobilised resources to assist in the fight against the pandemic. “The bulk of the items are personal protective equipment (PPE) as we would like our health professionals on the frontline to be protected. “We know that the task at hand is huge and this donation might appear small in comparison to the task, however, it is a sincere gesture to demonstrate AHFoZ commitment in complementing the Government in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and we will continue doing so.” Mrs Sanyanga said in addition to the donation, AHFoZ members already had prevention and wellness programmes which would be broadened to include educating their members on prevention of Covid-19. “There is need to collectively eliminate stigma associated with COVD-19 as this causes fear, denial and lack of full disclosure which might work against prevention efforts,” she said.
