Money transfer agencies will open three days a week starting today during the national lockdown to ensure those receiving money from the Diaspora directly can now get their cash. President Mnangagwa on Monday directed the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to ensure that money transfer service systems in the banking sector were working efficiently and accessible to the public promptly, especially processing of financial remittances from abroad. RBZ Governor Dr John Mangudya has ordered that these agencies, whether in their own premises or in banking halls, will open on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday each week, but that they must maintain social distancing and other health measures. Money transfer agencies in ordinary retail outlets will keep the same opening hours as the shop where they operate and those run by banks in banking halls or separate premises would be open from 9am to 3pm. To allow for operational adjustment, Dr Mangudya said the directive took effect from today. “The decision in respect of the extension of the above service is to allow for the receipt of foreign currency remittances, which cannot be transacted on any digital electronic platforms,” said Dr Mangudya.
