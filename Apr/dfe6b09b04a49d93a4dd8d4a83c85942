The Herald NEW-YORK. — Just days after showing off her dancing skills on Instagram, Catherine Zeta-Jones is now giving fans a glimpse at her piano and singing skills. The 50-year-old actress shared a new video on Instagram, where she belted out a soulful rendition of My Love by Paul McCartney and Wings. “A caftan and a keyboard, a little ditty from me to you,” the Chicago Oscar winner said in the caption of her Instagram video. Zeta-Jones was wearing a red caftan with her dark hair pulled back into a bun as she sat at the piano and belted out the tune. She is no stranger to showing off her musical talent, releasing a few singles in the early 1990s before her acting career took off. She won an Oscar for her portrayal of the murderous jazz singer Velma Kelly in the hit big-screen adaptation of the Broadway musical Chicago. She most recently portrayed Vicki Ellis in Queen America, a new series that debuted on Facebook Watch. Zeta-Jones was introduced to Michael Douglas at the Deauville Film Festival in 1998, by Danny DeVito, and they were engaged on New Year’s Eve 1999. They were married at the Plaza Hotel in New York City in November 2000, just months after their first child Dylan was born in August. Their second child Carys was born in April 2003. — dailymail.co.uk
