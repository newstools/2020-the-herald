The Herald LONDON. — English Premiership football side Chelsea are reportedly considering a shock swoop for Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Gabon forward moved to the Emirates Stadium in January 2018 and has been prolific in the English Premier League, scoring 49 goals for the north London club. However, he is yet to agree to a new deal at Arsenal and, with just one year remaining on his contract, is linked with a move away. His form has not gone unnoticed by Europe’s giant clubs, including Spanish duo Real Madrid and Barcelona and league rivals Manchester United. And according to Bleacher Report, Chelsea’s Frank Lampard is the latest manager to show an interest in the former Borussia Dortmund star. The Blues boss is keen to bolster his attacking ranks this summer and believes Aubameyang would add world-class ability to his squad. And Chelsea will seemingly be able to offer him Champions League football, something the Gunners cannot. Aubameyang has scored 17 league goals this season and is second to Jamie Vardy in the top scorer rankings. Meanwhile, former Arsenal striker Charlie Nicholas has called on the Gunners to negotiate a new deal with Aubameyang or sell their star striker. “I would say to him (Aubameyang): ‘Is it money, is the salary you’re looking for? Is that what we’ve got to do to keep you?’,” Nicholas told Sky Sports. “Because if he says yes, then Arsenal should do the deal, and that means come when the season ends or when we’re available to do transfers, then one or two sales will more than justify what his financial package may be.” — The Mirror.
