The Herald LONDON. — English Premier League football doctors are in talks aimed at creating a set of stringent protocols for clubs to follow once players return to group training. In an initiative led by top-flight bosses, medics from all 20 teams are in discussions to lay out guidelines to minimise the threat of a coronavirus outbreak. A dossier will be presented to club officials for consideration at the next shareholders’ meeting next week on Friday. Recommendations being put forward include: * To stagger medical tests for around four days prior to a return to training and regular testing for at least seven days after the resumption. * Asking players to arrive to sessions in their training gear and, to ensure social distancing, no use of communal showers. * For the opening days, players to be divided into small groups, with each allocated a time slot to arrive at the training ground. * To close, for a period, all cafeterias, with players asked to eat on their own away from team-mates. * Medical staff and physios to wear protective gear when in direct contact with players. In addition to these measures, players could be asked to carry out their own temperature checks at home, and training grounds will be deep-cleaned regularly to ensure optimum hygiene levels — particularly if anyone shows signs of infection. — Mailonline.
