The Herald LONDON. — World stock markets made a super-charged sprint towards a second straight week of gains last Friday after President Donald Trump laid out plans to gradually reopen the coronavirus-hit US economy following similar moves elsewhere. The bulls were back in business. Additional reports that patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms had responded positively to a drug made by US company Gilead Sciences had helped Tokyo and Seoul surge 3 percent as Asia took a widely-expected slump in Chinese GDP data in its stride. Europe’s main markets and Wall Street futures made 3 percent gains in early European trading too, putting the pan-regional STOXX 600 up almost 8 percent in the last two weeks and MSCI’s 49-country world index nearly 11 percent. The data from China had shown the world’s second-largest economy shrank for the first time since at least 1992 because of the coronavirus woes. — Reuters .
