The Herald Wanavokali, a mega-talented RnB group from Kenya, took top spot and won the grand prize of US$100 000 in the first season of the pan-African music competition, Old Mutual Amazing Voices. The competition is designed to discover unsigned singing talent from across the African continent – Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa – and across three genres – gospel, pop and R&B. The other two highly talented groups in the final round were Simply Six, a gospel group and Afrikariz, a pop group, both from South Africa. Due to the current global Covid-19 pandemic, live studio events could not take place and the Amazing Voices episodes leading up to the finale were pre-recorded within the pre-confinement time. <img class="wp-image-482770 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/OM-AmazingVoices-Wanavokali-2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="465" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/OM-AmazingVoices-Wanavokali-2.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/OM-AmazingVoices-Wanavokali-2-360x246.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Old Mutual Amazing Voices Finale Studio on Henly, Randburg in Johannesburg, South Africa.
