The Herald The City of Mutare  has pleaded with residents and ratepayers to pay their bills, inspite  of the Covid-19 lockdown, to enable it to provide critical services such  as refuse collection, and provision of clean water. Due to the lockdown, payment of rates and for other council services  has been affected, but municipal authorities said an online payment  platform had been established which ratepayers could now use. The country is in the fourth week of a five-week lockdown to check the  spread of Covid-19. Mutare City Council finance director Blessing Chafesuka said in order  for the council to effectively fight the pandemic, there is need for ratepayers to play their part by continuing to pay rates via online  platforms. Chafesuka said provision of clean water was particularly important now in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, which thrives in unclean and unhygienic environments. He said council had designated staff to help residents with the new online payment system. “We have our online banking, Ecocash, One Money and Telecash ready for  the convenience of our residents. This will help on social distancing  being recommended by health experts,”said Chafesuka. Council revenue inflows have declined to less than $100 000 a day in  the advent of the lockdown. — Pungwe News-New Ziana.
