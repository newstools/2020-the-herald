Employers have been called upon to uphold fair labour standards as enshrined in the constitution, during the ongoing lockdown period. This has been said by Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Professor Paul Mavima in a statement. The statement follows reports that some employers are considering retrenching or withholding their salaries for the period they are not at work due to the national lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. However Prof Mavima has called for dialogue to ensure the protection of employee rights and job security as well as continued business viability. Against this backdrop, a draft paper on comprehensive labour market measure for Covid-19 has been drafted and is being subjected to virtual consultations given the limitations to convene face-to-face meetings in line with the guidelines issued by health authorities. The ministry has also proposed workplace guidelines to properly guide employees and employers during the 21-day Covid-19 lockdown. The guidelines are also under tripartite consultations to ensure they align with labour standards and policy developments. They will be published soon.
