The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Kaizer Chiefs vice-captain Willard Katsande is optimistic they will win the South African Premiership football title if the 2019/20 season resumes after the current lockdown. South Africa has gone into lockdown in order to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country. The campaign was suspended with Chiefs sitting at the top of the league standings — four points above second-placed Mamelodi Sundowns, who have a game in hand. Zimbabwe international footballer, Katsande, explained how the lockdown, which started on March 27, has affected him and his teammates. “These are scary moments for us, but we have no choice but to follow what the healthcare professionals want us to do,” Katsande told New Zimbabwe. “We must all be careful in order not to transmit the disease from one person to another; stay home, use sanitisers and maintain social distancing. “The number of infected people is growing and we have to play our role as soccer players to educate people about the danger of this virus.” Katsande, who has won two PSL titles with Chiefs, admitted the lockdown period could derail the Soweto giants from the track. “It’s always difficult to come back to the form of your past after such a break. But we will be on top of our game,” the defensive midfielder said. “As a professional, you must get back on the horse and ride towards the finish line at high speed.” Chiefs have lost three times and won once in their last four competitive matches and Katsande stated they need to improve their sharpness before the league resumes. “We have to work on our sharpness and play two to three friendly games before we can resume our league schedule. That may help,” he concluded. — Goal.com.
