The Herald Fungai  Lupande Mash Central Bureau A music outfit of inmates from Bindura Prison called Voice of Worship Choir has released a soulful gospel song aimed at giving hope as the country and the rest of the world grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic. The song titled “Tirivakundi” mixes Shona and Nyanja languages. The 15-member group, which came together in 2017, was failing to record music due to lack of funds and were only concentrating on performances at various events. The group’s fortunes changed when Bindura-based producer, Tirivashe Zambuko, decided to record their song for free. Zambuko, who runs Tabeal Sound Lab, said the project was part of giving back to the community. He said the inmates exhibited a high level of responsibility, respect and honesty while they were working together. The group is working on another song, which will feature dendera musician Suluman Chimbetu, who is Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services brand ambassador. <img class="size-full wp-image-484237" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/inmates2.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/inmates2.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/inmates2-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Bindura Prison Band Assistant Principal Correctional Officer Vaughan Chinhoro said music has a positive moral and spiritual impact on inmates during this difficult time. He said Covid-19 was affecting everyone and the song speaks of hope in Jesus Christ. “Music is one of the four facets of our rehabilitation programme,” said Assistant Principal Correctional Officer Chinhoro. “The message in their songs must first transform the choir before it impacts on others. “They sing gospel music, which influences other inmates to transform. Even when they sing for the community, some people break down because of the choir’s touching lyrics.” Asst Principal Correctional Officer Chinhoro said they were no longer worried about the security of the group when they go out to perform because they had transformed morally. “They are realising that their music has a following in the community and they can earn a living out of it,” he said. Assistant Principal Correctional Officer Chinhoro said the group was in need of a new stage uniform since the one they were using was now worn out.
