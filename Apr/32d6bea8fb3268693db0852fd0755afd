The Herald Victor Maphosa Herald Correspondent. AN elderly Harare man has been arrested for allegedly raping his 14-year-old granddaughter. The man (66) allegedly sneaked into the girl’s bedroom at night, dragged her to his room before forcing himself on her. He reportedly threatened the girl with death if she reported. The matter came to light when the girl’s parents woke up to find the girl missing and investigations revealed she was being raped. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident. “On March 28 at around midnight, a 14-year-old girl was raped by her 66-year-old maternal grandfather at their home in Harare,” he said. “The accused woke up and went to where the victim was sleeping, stuffed her mouth and dragged her into his room where he raped her and warned her not to disclose the offence. “The offence was discovered by the victim’s parents who woke up to check on the children and found her missing. Investigations are in progress,” Asst Comm Nyathi said. Asst Comm Nyathi implored parents and guardians to ensure that their children were safe at all times. Recently, a 22-year-old man from Plumtree was arrested after he robbed and raped his 71-year-old employer before fleeing the scene. Justice Ndebele alias Majority (22) of Dilankombe Village was arrested on February 13 for armed robbery and rape. Asst Comm Nyathi said Ndebele attacked his female employer, stole some cash and two cellphones and then raped her before tying her hands and legs with a rope. He said the victim managed to untie herself before making a police report which lead to Ndebele’s arrest  and the recovery of the stolen property. After the arrest, it was discovered that Ndebele was on the list of suspects wanted by police for various criminal cases.
