The Herald Victor Maphosa Herald Correspondent MORE than 1 900 have so far been arrested for defying the 21-day lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, in the first week. Almost all offenders were fined between $200 and $500. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said: “About 1 918 people across the country were arrested for various offences in defiance of the 21-day lockdown,” he said. “Only yesterday 22 were arrested for liquor-related offences, 14 were nabbed for ferrying passengers without exemptions while 47 were arrested for operating businesses without exemptions. About 106 were arrested for unnecessary movement, 39 for gathering in public places and 179 for other offences,” he said. Asst Comm Nyathi warned those who continue to defy the directive that they risk being arrested. “We have been urging the public to comply with all measures and directives but some are in the habit of defying it. Those who will be found on the wrong side of the law will be arrested. “We also observed that a lot of people are not practising social distancing. Others are busy holding parties for large numbers at their homes thereby exposing others and their families to the virus. We are urging everyone to stop the habit. Others buy beer and drink in buses or just closing themselves in beerhalls and start drinking while inside. The police are fully aware of that and soon they will pounce on the offenders,” he said. Meanwhile police have increased their presence in market places where farmers can sell their produce to ensure health rules are enforced.
