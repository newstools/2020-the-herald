Today marks 24 years after the death of sungura legend Leonard Dembo who left a void difficult to fill in showbiz. Born Kwangwari Gwaindepi, the Chitekete hit-maker will best be remembered for his all-time classics, which made him a household name both locally and abroad. While his remains were interred in Chirumhanzu, his music legacy will be remembered for years to come as he was indeed an accomplished composer whose songs were prophetic. However, his sons Morgan and Tendai, who have also ventured into music, are finding it hard to fill the big shoes he left. Between the two, Tendai has been doing a sterling job in trying to revive his father’s band while Morgan has on many occasions had a brush with the law. Sadly, most of the founding members of Barura Express are now late except Innocent Mjintu who has been desperate to save his late mentor’s legacy. Some of the musicians like Cindy Munyavi and Stunner had done renditions of Dembo songs as a way of paying tribute to the late icon.
