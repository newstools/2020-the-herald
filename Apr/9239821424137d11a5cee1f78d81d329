THERE is good news for CAPS United — the club’s leaders want to regain their Cup Kings tag. Nhamo Tutisani, the club’s vice president, said it was time they got back to winning trophies the way they used to in the past. The Green Machine have invested in about 22 new players. “There are some things which teams are very much known for,’’ he said. ‘‘For decades, our reputation as CAPS United has not been about winning the league title.’’ “Our brand has always been associated with winning cup competitions.’’ “If anything, it is in this regard where we have fared dismally as a club, in recent years.’’ “You know, even in athletics, there are those who do well in sprints while others are good in marathon.’’ “As a club, we have always done very well in winning Cup competitions.’’ ‘‘We want to revive that culture, as soon as the season commences. We have challenged ourselves as a club who should play well in all respects of the game.” The Harare businessman said their ultimate aim remains winning the league title though they will not put any pressure on the team. “Remember, this is almost a new team altogether. We have taken a business approach in the running of the team this year,’’ he said. ‘‘It’s a wholly professional and business entity now.’’ ‘‘We will be competitive, yes, but as businesses do, we will be trying to balance everything. But, as I said, our brand has largely been known as kings of tournament football.’’ ‘‘We have won so many Cups over the years but, we have failed to do the same over the last 10 or so years’’. “So, we are saying we need to start from somewhere. We need to revive our reputation as the kings of tournament football first and that will also lift us into winning everything.” Coach Darlington Dodo had to drop some good players from the team to meet the Premier Soccer League quota. The players include former captain Valentine Musarurwa, Kudzi Nyamupfukudza, Clive Rupiya and Tinashe Balakasi.
