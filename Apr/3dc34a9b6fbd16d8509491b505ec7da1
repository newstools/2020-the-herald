The Herald The impact of coronavirus on the local tourism is increasingly being felt, with the African Sun Limited Group shutting down 14 hotels and resorts, as well as its main corporate office. The move comes in the wake of lockdown measures that have been implemented by Government to combat the pandemic. The outbreak and rapid spread of coronavirus poses a significant threat to all of Zimbabwe’s economy, and the tourism sector has not been spared. Said African Sun managing director Edwin Shangwa in a statement: “The well-being of our staff and guests remains top priority, and in light of this we have taken the decision to close the following strategic business units, hotels and resorts with effect from March 30, 2020: “Elephant Hills Resort and Conference Centre, Victoria Falls, Monomotapa Hotel Harare, Hwange Safari Lodge, Dete, Caribbea Bay Resort Kariba,  Troutbeck Resort Nyanga, just to name a few. We will continue  to monitor the situation and once contained we will consider  reopening after stipulated period of 21 days lockdown.” —  Business Reporter.
