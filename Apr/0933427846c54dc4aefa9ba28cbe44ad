The Herald Victor Maphosa Herald Correspondent POLICE are looking for a maid who reportedly kidnapped her employer’s five-year-old son in Kuwadzana and later dumped him in Marondera. Isabel Makuya (33) disappeared with the child on March 13, but the boy was later found in Marondera and has since been reunited with his family. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident saying the maid was likely to face kidnapping charges. “Police in Marondera have rescued a five-year-old boy, who is believed to have been kidnapped by a housemaid in Kuwadzana, Harare. The maid disappeared with the boy on March 13, 2020 and never came back. “The boy was found in Marondera by a resident who informed the police,” he said. Asst Comm Nyathi urged people to thoroughly check their potential house helpers’ backgrounds before hiring them. “Members of the public are warned against picking up domestic workers from the streets without properly checking their background. “They should rather make use of the police vetting system when employing maids to enhance security of families,” he said. “Police are currently looking for Isabel Makuya, who is believed to be from Chigondo area, Wedza. She is light in complexion, slim and tall,” he said. “Makuya was last seen wearing a white top, khaki skirt and white tennis shoes. Anyone with information on her whereabouts should report to any nearest police station or ZRP Dombotombo on 065 2323572.” Asst Comm Nyathi said kidnapping cases involving housemaids were on the increase.
