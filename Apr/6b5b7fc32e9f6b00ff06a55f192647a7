FORMER Dynamos forward, Kuda Kumwala’s intended move to the South African ABSA Premiership, has been put on hold because of the coronavirus lockdown. Kumwala is close to joining Highlands Park. But, the club could not risk bringing a foreign player, and committing themselves to paying him, when there is no football being played at the moment. According to the South African media, Kumwala’s manager, Michael Ngobeni, said although the player spent time at Highlands, and even made an  impression, a deal was never reached. “The boy was with Highlands Park for almost a month and he impressed the club,’’ said Ngobeni. “But, because of the coronavirus, the boy never signed with the club. “He was told that he was going to be contacted after the (end of the break caused by) the coronavirus. “I am aware of the reports that the boy has already signed with the club, but those reports are not true. “The boy is already back home in Zimbabwe as we speak. Surely, the club cannot sign a player under these conditions (with COVID-19), I’m just giving you the facts now.’’ Kumwala began his career at Division One club, Hartley Academy, where he had an outstanding season before he joined Harare City in the 2015 season. The striker later moved to Dynamos where he formed a partnership with Cameronian forward Epoupa Ntouba.
