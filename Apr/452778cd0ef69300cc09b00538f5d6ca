The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Self-proclaimed homebody Yanga Sobetwa has got all the answers, while many of us struggle with staying indoors during the 21-day national lockdown. The Idols SA winner says she enjoys her own space more than the average person. Below the 19-year-old songbird gives five tips on surviving the lockdown: If I’m not at school, I’m at home. If I’m not at a gig, I’m home. That’s it for me. I’m someone who loves my space and just being by myself. To entertain myself  I watch a lot of YouTube videos. I connect with myself. I reflect a lot and it helps me to be intact with myself — especially my emotional and mental wellbeing. I also use the time to come up with a lot of new ideas. I make sure that my spiritual self is nourished as well. I read the Bible every day, read the word of the lord and pray every day. This is to solidify my spirit, so that when I go out I’m able to deal with certain situations in a wise manner. I eat a lot. I make sure that I’m well fed. My goal is to gain a few kilos. I have been going to the gym a lot, but I feel like I’ve been losing the weight instead of toning the way I want. For me it’s a good thing, while for others it’s not. I try to connect with friends and family. Not daily, but I try my best. Below are some Quarantunes that Gallo record company have compiled to help you survive the weekend.
