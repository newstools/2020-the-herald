The Herald LOCKDOWN has encouraged many of us to embrace a simpler beauty regime, whether that’s partaking in the #nohairwashchallenge or trying out Tiktok-approved face mask containing ingredients from the kitchen cupboard. But, perhaps most noticeably, make-up has been the last thing on our minds — and, for once, celebrities agree with us. Famous faces have in their droves been going, err, bare-faced, and they look wonderfully normal. From Kylie Jenner picking up snacks, to Victoria Beckham in PJs and Rita Ora in gym kit, a host of stars have been sharing on social media how they are letting their skin breathe now the coronavirus pandemic has put public appearances, red carpet events and A-list parties on hold. The 22-year-old lip kit billionaire appeared to be having a break from her own products when she stepped out without a scrap of make-up — prompting amazement at how different she looked from her usual Instagram-perfect image. Meanwhile, the 46-year-old Spice Girl — who celebrated her birthday last week — has been allowing her natural beauty to shine through as she lies low in the Cotswolds with her dogs, amid furore about furloughing her fashion label staff. <img class="size-full wp-image-484242" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/Drew-Barrymore.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/Drew-Barrymore.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/Drew-Barrymore-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Drew Barrymore Following suit, Nicola Roberts (34) looked amazing when she posted a selfie following a 5k run. Fellow red-head, Jessica Chastain (43) has also revealed her flawless bare skin in a recent picture. Kate Bosworth (37) opted for nothing but a slick of lip gloss for a baking session. Similarly, Dakota Fanning (26) had no qualms about going without the slap in a snap for her fans. Drew Barrymore (45) has not only embraced the no-make-up look — but also allowed her wavy hair to flow free and gone without nail polish. Looking better after a workout than most of us do normally was a bare-faced Melanie Sykes (49). Sophie Turner (24) and Kate Hudson (41) have shared selfies looking a world away from the more glamorous looks they usually sport on the red carpet. Amanda Seyfried (34), Vicky Pattison (32) and Nicole Scherzinger (41) are likewise keeping things more low-key in quarantine. Bella Hadid (23) embraced her natural beauty as she soaked up the sun, while a fresh-faced Rita Ora (29) chilled at home in gym kit. Jacqueline Jossa (27), Katy Perry (35) and Jennifer Lopez (50) have also been going back to basics for their days in self-isolation. — The Sun.
