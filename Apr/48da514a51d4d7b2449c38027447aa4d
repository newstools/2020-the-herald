The Herald Africa Moyo Deputy News Editor The number of Zimbabwean medical practitioners willing to offer free consultations over the phone during the 21-day lockdown period has risen to 17. A specialist urologist based at Mpilo Hospital in Bulawayo, Dr Hassan Ashmawy, told The Herald yesterday that more doctors had accepted to offer free phone consultations. The team is made up of cardiologists, gynaecologists, paediatricians, oncologists, ophthalmologists and dentists and two are nurses. “The number has grown, we are now 17,” said Dr Ashmawy. He came up with the initiative on Sunday, after realising the extent to which citizens in need of medical attention would be impacted by the 21-day lockdown. Dr Ashmawy said it was commendable that the doctors and nurses decided to “unite, step up and make the world a better place”. The facility is open to everyone, and the doctors are based in various towns and cities. A patient will call the doctors to set a phone consultation appointment or for further details on the nature of their consultations. Dr Ashmawy said the development saves one from physically travelling to the doctor’s office and risk catching or spreading the highly contagious coronavirus. Some Covid-19 cases in the world have been transmitted either by doctors to their patients or vice versa, hence the move to assist patients over the phone.
