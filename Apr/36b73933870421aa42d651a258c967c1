The Herald Enacy Mapakame Investors on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) lost a cumulative $1 billion in the week to Wednesday as stocks traded mixed amid uncertainties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. World over, investors have incurred huge losses following the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic which has caused severe disturbances to economic activity.
