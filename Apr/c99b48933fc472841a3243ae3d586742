Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and other informal traders are being encouraged to register with their associations to receive incentives, which will assist them during the 21-day lockdown. Minister of Women’s Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Dr Sithembiso Nyoni said the initiative was put in place by President Mnangagwa. “To ensure that the money reaches the actual beneficiaries, my ministry has asked all the informal traders to register through our provincial offices using their own associations, because each vending sector has associations, so they have to use these associations for the registration process,” said Dr Nyoni. “This will enable us to ascertain that these people are authentic, but there are some that don’t have associations, so we are asking them to register through our ward officers at district or provincial offices.” Dr Nyoni said the funds to cushion the vulnerable, which included the informal sector were being administered by the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare. “It is possible that some handlers may want to benefit over and above the legitimate beneficiaries. The Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare and my ministry will vet the registers and will make sure it is done professionally and properly so that the intended beneficiaries get the funding.”
