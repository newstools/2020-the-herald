CHJAA Enterprise (Private) Limited yesterday donated 55 re-usable face masks to The Herald editorial team for use during their assignments. Handing over the donation to managing editor Ruth Butaumocho at Herald House yesterday afternoon, CHJAA co-founder and chief executive Ms Celia Rukato said the gesture was in appreciation of the essential service provided by the media to the nation during the lockdown period. “We are aware that journalists are offering an essential service and they meet and mingle with various people while carrying out their duties,” she said. “Therefore, we decided to donate some personal protective clothing in the form of re-usable masks so that they may be protected while on duty. “We also understand that they are not immune to contracting the deadly pandemic, hence the donation. This donation is not ending here, we are planning to do more in various sectors so that we contribute to the fight against Covid-19.” Local manufacture
Butaumocho thanked CHJAA Enterprise for the gesture, saying it would go a long way in protecting journalists in the course of their duties. “The (local) manufacture of the masks is an initiative that will enable the nation to cut on imports, particularly during the Covid-19 era,” she said. “We are grateful to receive this donation from CHJAA which will assist our personnel in executing their duties. We commend the gesture.” Journalists have been designated as providers of essential services by disseminating information during the Covid-19 lockdown, but remain at risk as they often come into contact with scores of people while performing their duties.
