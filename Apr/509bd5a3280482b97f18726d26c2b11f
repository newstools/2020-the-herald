The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — The current South African 2019/20 Premier Soccer League season remains suspended but a club official has since indicated that the consensus is to complete all matches, even if they run until October. The league has yet to issue a formal update on the situation facing the outcome of the Absa Premiership campaign amid the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown in place in the country. There have been suggestions around the world of perhaps ending the season as is, with the current log positions made final, while the Eredivisie this weekend declared their season null and void. However, AmaZulu general manager Lunga Sokhela has provided some insight into discussions taking place within the PSL and its Covid-19 task team, which was assembled at the Board of Governors meeting on March 20. “From our side, we have also been trying to get information [from the PSL], and I guess we have to sympathise a little bit with the guys that are running the league, because they also rely on government’s guidance,” Sokhela told reporters during a virtual press conference. “Government also can’t give definitive answers because they are assisting people and still trying to figure out how the virus is spreading, etc. But what I can confirm is that in principle, clubs at the last BOG said they want to continue to finish the season. — KickOff
