The Herald LONDON.  — Formula One is mourning the loss of motor racing great Stirling Moss, who has died at the age of 90. His wife Lady Moss told the PA news agency he died peacefully at his London home in the early hours of Sunday morning following a long illness. “It was one lap too many,” she said. “He just closed his eyes.” Six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, who built a close friendship with Moss, said on Instagram Moss would always be “in our memories and will always be such a huge part of British Motorsports Heritage.” Three-time world champion Jackie Stewart, who collected Moss’ autograph as a youngster and went on to become Godfather to his son Elliot, told BBC Five Live Moss “walked like a racing driver should walk, he talked like a racing driver, he looked like a racing driver and he set a standard that I think has been unmatched since he retired”. And another former world champion, Damon Hill, said Moss “epitomised” what it was to be a racing driver to a generation. “The guy cocked a snook at danger and took on an incredibly difficult challenge and prevailed,” he said. — AFP.
