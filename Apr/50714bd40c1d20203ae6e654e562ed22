The world has been hit by the pandemic coronavirus and some countries have taken extraordinary measures to fight the spread of the deadly disease. The safest and quickest measure which is prescribed to everyone is staying at home. The Government has put restrictions on travelling, ban of mass gatherings, urge people to stay indoors and has even prescribed the 21-day lockdown. As the pandemic rampages across the world, ordinary people are taking to social media to express concern over the disease and share precautions they are taking to protect themselves. Below, local celebrities, models, musicians share how they are spending time under the lockdown; Jah Prayzah (Musician)
It is tough times we are in but by following regulations put in place to safeguard us, we will pull through.
I urge people to adhere to what we have been told and that is to stay at home, wash your hands regularly and also practice social distance.
The rest we leave to God and the people he is using to help us sail through this pandemic.
I am at home with my family and I have made sure that the gate is always locked all the time.
We are playing games and watching movies with my children.
My work has definitely been affected but it is for the greater good and with that I am happy. I will use this time to even be more creative and come up with other projects. Stay safe and stay blessed!!! <img class="size-full wp-image-467342" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/0901-1-1-UNNAMED.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/0901-1-1-UNNAMED.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/0901-1-1-UNNAMED-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Jah Prayzah Vimbai Mukambi (Commercial model)
My advice is no amount of money can replace a life at this moment. What matters is your life and that of your loved ones, research more information about this Covid-19 while at home and try to follow the necessary steps to prevent contracting the virus. Pray to God. I am alone, in Dubai and we are now on our second week of lockdown, My family is in Zimbabwe and I communicate with them every-day urging them not to go out but to stay home. I spend my time on the Internet for latest updates about the disease and I love cooking and this is the time to experiment what I always watch on television. I am also glued to Netflix and reading some motivational books. Please be safe! Sabastian Magacha (Musician)

Our thoughts are with you in these difficulty times. Coronavirus is real and it has continued to affect the lives across the globe.

Every trying time comes to an end and if we respect set rules we will be safe. Ndezvashe!!! Mai Titi (Comedian)
To everyone in Zimbabwe, please follow instructions and rules of lockdown. Look for something to entertain you with at home even watch movies because this lockdown is stressful and it is hard staying at home. This is the time to reflect on yourself, meditate and pray to God. Always communicate with friends and family through mobile phone. I am in the United Kingdom and we are also on lockdown with my cousin. We always pray and call back home. I am also doing live feeds on social media and I came here for shows and can you imagine, all were cancelled because of Covid-19 and I can’t wait to see my children. But I can’t come because there are no planes coming to Zimbabwe. Stay home, stay safe. Janet Manyowa (Musician)
I would like to press upon the public to the health and social distancing measures put in place by the authorities to stop the spread of the epidemic in our beloved nation. Above all, our hope and trust is in the Lord. I am fully convinced that God will heal our land and the world at large in due time. During this lockdown period I am trying by all means to keep myself active and healthy. This includes taking time to exercise and eating healthy. I am also working from home, getting time to connect and bond with my family. I am also taking time to read books and the Bible. Beverly Sibanda (Dancer)
Coronavirus is real: stay safe, stay clean. How can we say 21 days is too much, yet we were in our mothers’ wombs for nine months? Let us be strong and unite it will pass soon. Somehow this quarantine is too much but that is what it is. Please stay at home. Mudiwa Hood (Musician)
I am home working. If not I am in the studio at my house, I am on Zoom meetings with my work colleagues. As a responsible citizen I have chosen to make use of my influence also to alert masses and update them on coronavirus from the official information put by the Ministry of Health on their social media handles. I practise hygiene, wash hands with soap regularly and also not allowing visitors whatsoever. Staying at home is the safest bet.
