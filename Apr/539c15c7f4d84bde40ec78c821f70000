Chitungwiza Municipality is seeking US$3 million from corporates and well-wishers for the construction of an isolation centre for Covid-19 patients at Seke South Clinic. If raised, the funds will be used to renovate two other facilities that will be used as medical centres. Acting Chitungwiza town clerk Dr Tonderai Kasu yesterday said they were in dire need of resources necessary for the containment of the virus. He said they had asked for assistance from the Ministry of Health and Child Care and the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works, which expressed their full support for the initiatives. “I have written to Ministers Obadiah Moyo and July Moyo informing them of Chitungwiza’s plans with respect to renovations, refurbishments and construction at all three of the sites, as well as the equipment and other materials needed,” said Dr Kasu. “Our response budget for the pandemic is US$3 093 727. We also requested assistance both in cash and in kind. We are also appealing for support from the corporate world, donors and development partners. We hope that steady progress will be made towards completion of these projects so that the virus will find us prepared.”
