The Herald LONDON. — Former Chelsea star Didier Drogba has offered his hospital in Ivory Coast to be used as a coronavirus treatment centre, as the country prepares for a huge jump in cases. The hospital — that is based in the city of Abidjan — opened in 2016 and is named after former Ivory Coast footballer Laurent Pokou, who passed away in the same year it opened. The current outbreak of the coronavirus has remained manageable across Africa, however, there are fears the deadly virus is about to spread much more rapidly. Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak five people have died and 574 cases have been registered in Ivory Coast. Drogba has been recognised for his “patriotic gesture” from Vincent Toh Bi Irie, the head of Abidjan’s regional council, who said the hospital will help them fight the disease. “We thank Drogba for this gift considered as an act of patriotism,” Toh Bi said. The first case of coronavirus was recorded in the country on March 11 and since there have been 574 people diagnosed with the virus and five have died. — Mailonline.
