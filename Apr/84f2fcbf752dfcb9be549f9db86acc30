The Herald LONDON.  — Stan Kroenke will provide Arsenal with a major cash injection to help ease the English Premiership football club through the coronavirus financial crisis. And in another boost, the club are moving closer to negotiating a pay reduction with manager Mikel Arteta while there is growing hope a wage deal can be struck with the playing squad. Owner Kroenke has often been criticised by Arsenal supporters for what some perceive as a lack of spending in the transfer market. But Sportsmail understands the American businessman has guaranteed to pump a significant amount, which will run into millions, into Arsenal to soften the blow of the Covid-19 pandemic. His financial support comes at a time when his NFL franchise the LA Rams are facing spiralling costs to complete their new stadium — which is a reported $2bn over budget. Meanwhile, the club are in talks with Arteta over taking a pay cut on his £5million salary — but the main focus is on agreeing a wage reduction deal with the playing squad. — Mailonline.
