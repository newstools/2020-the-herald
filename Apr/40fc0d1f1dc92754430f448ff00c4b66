The Herald ASUNCION. — Ronaldinho has made one special request during his house arrest in Paraguay — to be able to play football. The Barcelona and Brazil legend was released from prison earlier this month after he was arrested for arriving in Paraguay with a fake passport and identity card. After his US$1.6 million (£1.3m) bail was paid, Ronaldinho and his brother, who was also arrested, were moved out of prison and placed under house arrest in Paraguay. The pair are now serving their time at the four-and-a-half star Hotel Palmaroga in Paraguay’s capital Asuncion. But due to the current lockdown in Paraguay following the coronavirus outbreak, Ronaldinho, his brother, and their two lawyers are the only ones in the hotel. “Ronaldinho does not lose his temper and he alternates his conversations with jokes,” Emilio Yegros, the manager of the hotel, told Mexican newspaper Excelsior. “He seems like a good guy. He never loses his smile, neither does his brother. His countenance changed from the first day, when he arrived tense and stressed.” Yegros also revealed Ronaldinho specifically asked for a football and a room to play in. “We have given him a hall of about 30 metres by 15 for his kickabouts,” Yegros said.— Metro.
