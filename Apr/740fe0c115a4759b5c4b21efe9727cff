The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Khama Billiat is among the top goalscorers in the history of the South African Premiership since the league’s inception in the 1996/1997 season. In the inaugural season of the newly formed PSL, Manning Rangers shocked the country by lifting the Castle Premiership and since then Mamelodi Sundowns have dominated with nine league titles. It comes as no surprise to see six of their former players among the South African top-flight scoring icons led by none other than Daniel Mudau. Madau spent his entire professional career at Sundowns with the exception of a loan stint at Ratanang Mahlosiane in 1992, where he scored seven goals. The Brazilians’ all-time top goalscorer netted 172 goals for the club, 110 of which were netted in the PSL era, ranking him as the most prolific domestic striker of all-time and second on the list of PSL-era greats. Only Bafana Bafana legend Siyabonga Nomvethe, who is still active at 42, scored more goals in all PSL competitions with 123 goals to his name since making his debut for African Wanderers 23 years ago. His 42 goals in 79 games for Kaizer Chiefs after joining the club in 1998 earned him a move to Serie A side Udinese but he returned to Mzansi on two different occasions to amass his overall total. Nomvethe’s most successful spell was with the now-defunct Moroka Swallows, where he scored 53 goals in 149 league games between 2009 and 2016, finishing the 2011/12 season with the Lesley Manyathela Golden Boot for his 20 goals. Kaizer Chiefs star Billiat is the only player in the top 10 list who is still active in the Absa Premiership today, with 83 goals to his name since making his debut for Ajax Cape Town in the 2010/11 campaign. The Zimbabwe international joined Masandawana in 2013 in a reported R9-million transfer from the Urban Warriors and went on to lift three league titles, scoring 47 goals in all competitions for Pitso Mosimane’s side. Since his impressive spell at Downs his shock move to Naturena on a free transfer is yet to yield the kind of success he enjoyed at Chloorkop, but the 29-year-old remains in contention to climb towards Nomvethe’s elusive 123-goal  tally. His 12 goals for Amakhosi have moved him above Anthony Laffor (79), Bernard Parker (77) and Lehlohonolo Majoro (77), who are the only other active players who could still break into the top 10 in the all-time record books. Special mentions not in the top 10: Alton Meiring (79) also scored 11 goals prior to the start of the PSL era, Abram Raselemane (74) and Denis Lota (74) — Kick-Off.
