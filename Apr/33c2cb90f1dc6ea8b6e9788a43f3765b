The Herald Masvingo Bureau A total of 121 people have been arrested across Masvingo province for violating lockdown rules as law enforcement authorities pull out all the stops to make sure people stay indoors to curb the spread of Covid-19. Masvingo has largely remained a safe haven with all the suspected cases tested so far coming out negative.

She implored people across Masvingo to stay indoors and keep their families safe from coronavirus.
