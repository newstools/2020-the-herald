FORMER Harare Basketball League chairman, Sunny Mbofana, has been handed the reins to lead the newly-formed SADC Basketball League. Mbofana, who is the chairman of Harare City Hornets, was appointed the president of the league last week when the leadership held their inaugural virtual meeting. A renowned sports administrator, who has been in basketball since 1992, Mbofana was given the responsibility to make a difference to the organisation. “Firstly, I am humbled by this appointment. It’s a huge responsibility I have been entrusted with and I will try to deliver,” said Mbofana. “Being appointed to a high office like this means a lot for the game in Zimbabwe. “As a country, we haven’t been doing so well both at club and national team levels. Our clubs have participated in regional tournaments, as well as continental competitions, but they haven’t been doing as well. “We need to up the level of our game locally, regionally and internationally.” Save for City Hornets (men) and Foxes, other teams have, of late, been a disappointing lot when it comes to regional tournaments. Harare City Hornets top the standings for both male and female sections. Mbofana, who until his resignation over a year ago has been the Harare Basketball Association chairman, will be deputised by Zambia’s Conrad Musonda in the SADC Basketball league. Malawi’s Lisungu Banda comes in as the secretary-general with James Kalebwe of Botswana filling the treasurer’s post.
