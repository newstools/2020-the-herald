The Herald With the King Dollar cheering the market’s risk-off moves, Gold traders seem to remain depressed. The yellow metal drops to US$1 714,80, down 0,08 percent on a day, during the pre-Europe session yesterday. While the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) warning of a global recession, coupled with the surge in the coronavirus (Covid-19) fatalities, propelled the US dollar the previous day, recently released virus data adds to the broad risk-off. As per Reuters, the US registers the single-day record increase in the virus death toll by 2 371 to 30,817. Also supporting the risk aversion could be the IMF’s comments that Asia’s economic growth this year will grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years (mainly due to the deadly virus). That said, the risk catalysts, namely stocks in Asia and the US futures, remain on the back foot while the US 10-year Treasury yields seesaw around 0,65 percent by the press time. – FXStreet.
