The Herald ATLANTA. — After creating the star-studded #HesGotTheWholeWorldChallenge to raise Covid-19 awareness, Tyler Perry decided to use some of his US$600 million fortune to help the staff at one of his favourite restaurants in Atlanta. Last Sunday, the 50-year-old movie-television mogul left a US$500 tip for each of the 42 out-of-work servers employed at the West Paces location of Houston’s while picking up a to-go order, according to TMZ. Perry’s US$21 000 tip serves as a bit of a cushion for the struggling workers, who might have to wait up to 20 weeks for a US$1 200 (and US$500 for each child) stimulus check from the federal government. As of Sunday, 219 people in Georgia have died from coronavirus and a further 6,742 have been infected, according to 11Alive.com. On Thursday last week, Governor Brian Kemp issued a stay-at-home order (but kept beaches, parks and churches open) after drawing criticism for not being aware that ‘this virus is now transmitting before [asymptomatic] people see signs.’ Tyler (born Emmitt Perry Jr.) is well known for his generous charitable acts and he employs 400 people at his 330-acre military base-turned-studio in Atlanta featuring 12 sound stages, which he acquired in 2015. Fans can tune into one of the three shows the New Orleans-born, Atlanta-based show runner created for BET The Oval, Sistas, and Ruthless. Tyler is also the mastermind behind OWN’s ‘‘The Haves and the Have Nots’’ ‘and Nickelodeon’s Young Dylan. The A Fall from Grace director is likely hunkering down in ‘prayer and meditation’ with his five-year-old son Aman and his partner since 2009, Ethiopian model Gelila Bekele. — dailymailuk.
