The Herald Minister of Tourism Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane says government has reached no final decision yet on the fate of South African Airways, but she is hopeful that a decision may have been made by the end of June. Kubayi-Ngubane, who is also chairperson of the economic cluster in Parliament, said on Wednesday that “all the avenues” still had to be examined. “It is not yet finalised what will happen to SAA. Once we have looked at all the avenues we can decide on a strategy to present to Cabinet for a decision,” she said during a briefing hosted by SA Tourism. “Government continues to interact with unions in this regard after they (unions) raised questions on how the business rescue practitioners of SAA are conducting themselves.” The business rescue practitioners have already indicated that, with government having rejected its last request for funding on 10 April, they will not be able to run the airline longer than the end of the month and might have no other option than to apply to the court to have it liquidated. — fin24.com
