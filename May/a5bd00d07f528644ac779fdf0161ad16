The Herald Blessings Chidakwa Municipal Correspondent Four Harare City Council workers and one of their superiors in the water department stationed at Morton Jaffray Waterworks are facing charges of stealing imported water purification chemicals, batteries for the back-up generator and empty sacks. Initial indications are that the city lost 135kg of high test hypochlorite (HTH) chlorine enough to purify 42 megalitres. While Harare has been blaming chemical shortages on the lack of foreign currency, thefts could have been going on for years. This brings a new perspective on lack of accountability. Officials among the quintet (names supplied) are also being implicated in the theft of two batteries used for the back-up generator at the city’s main water treatment plant. In case of power outages at Morton Jaffray, Harare may actually be no longer able to pump water due to the theft of the back-up generator batteries. A worker, in what is suspected to be a syndicate, was caught red-handed stealing 2 000 empty sacks used for storing filter sand. Harare Mayor Councillor Herbert Gomba yesterday confirmed the thefts. “I have asked the town clerk to institute some investigation at the plant. Surely we must rein in on unnecessary expenditures that cost our council much more than we must be costed. These reports have been coming to us for long and it is time we act and we are going to do exactly that. The plant boss, Senior Superintendent Paul Chabata must explain why he must continue to lead if all that is coming out,” he said. The city’s corporate communications manager Mr Michael Chideme said investigations were underway.
