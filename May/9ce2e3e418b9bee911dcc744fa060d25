The Herald It might take some time before schools re-open and normal educational activities return to normal. Anticipating such a scenario, discussions have started between the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education and the national broadcaster, ZBC. The thinking is that ZBC should air government-approved educational programmes on its platforms so that childrenâ€™s education does not suffer as a result of the nationwide lockdown. The planned programmes would cover primary and secondary school lessons. Before Independence, the national broadcaster used to offer lessons on radio and television. Other precedents of this form of delivering educational lessons to pupils and students have previously worked in Australia, for example.
