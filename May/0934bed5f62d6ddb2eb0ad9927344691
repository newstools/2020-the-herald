The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — He is a Rugby World Cup-winning captain, a keen surfer, a cricket follower and a die-hard Liverpool fan, but Siya Kolisi’s sporting interests do not stop there. The darling of South African rugby is set to appear on NBA Africa Game Time alongside singer Sho Madjozi where he speaks about his passion for basketball. Kolisi was in America in 2018 where he watched Brooklyn Nets home game, and he says that experience opened his eyes on the sport. “Going to the game was just the next level. I really loved every single moment of it. It actually makes you realise how much this is so different compared to what we do,” he said. “The professionalism that I saw, the facilities they have, the vibe in the stadium … it’s not just a basketball game, there’s a whole lot more than that.” Kolisi has also just finished watching the ESPN documentary on the career of NBA legend Michael Jordan, The Last Dance. “It’s very hardcore. You get to see what makes MJ so great. And you see his type of leadership as well,” he said. “It’s really amazing to see what made them get to that level and how much they played for each other. “He works hard, he’s got that drive. That was the most important thing that I got from it is that if you want to make it and you want it bad enough, you push yourself and all those around you.” Kolisi added that he saw basketball growing in popularity in South Africa in the years to come. “Basketball is not just a game. I think that everything that comes with it, the swag, the fashion, the style and music as well, I think it brings everything together,” he said. “You see how they come to the game, with all the fashion, dressed up however you want, and some bring their kids. It’s really amazing and something I think South African people and African people appreciate.”— AFP.
