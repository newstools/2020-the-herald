The Herald LONDON. — Wladimir Klitschko is willing to spar Oleksandr Usyk in order to help him in preparation for facing Derek Chisora. The 44-year-old retired three years ago after being stopped in 11 rounds against Anthony Joshua, and despite the offer of a rematch, the Ukrainian hung up his gloves. Klitschko, who has been forced to deny rumours of a comeback, revealed he has still been training and was even recently sparring with ex-crusierweight king Usyk. And the former heavyweight ruler is open to staying in camp and sharing his knowledge with his countryman, and assured Usyk it will cost him nothing. Klitschko told Mixsport.pro: “Oleksandr’s fight with Derek Chisora will give answers to many questions. Oleksandr is ready for this fight. “I always support him. I even worked for him as a sparring partner. We last sparred several months ago. “Will there be sparring matches in preparation for the fight with Chisora? Anthropometrically, I do not look much like Derek. “But for a warm-up I am always ready to help Oleksandr with great pleasure and absolutely free of charge.” Chisora and Usyk saw their main-event headliner postponed amid the coronavirus crisis, with the fight now facing the possibility of going behind closed doors with the British Board of Boxing Control aiming to have events back by July. It gives Usyk more time to pick the brains of Klitschko, who happens to have a bitter history with Chisora. The Ukrainian was due to fight the Brit in 2010, but he pulled out just days before the title defence, citing a back injury. Chisora would go on to fight his brother Vitali in 2012, and spat water in Wladimir’s face in the ring just before the first bell sounded. Vitali retained the WBC belt on points in Munich, and in the post-fight press conference David Haye would goad Chisora over his loss, leading to their infamous brawl. Haye would beat Chisora in their grudge match before amazingly becoming his manager in 2018. — The Sun
