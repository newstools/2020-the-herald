A Gokwe man poisoned his biological father after accusing him of causing misfortunes in his life. Justine Chakauya (28) of Village 15A, Chireya in Gokwe, was arraigned before a Gokwe magistrate facing murder charges after he poisoned his father, Benias Chakauya. Gokwe magistrate Mr Musaiona Shortgame remanded him in custody to June 3 and advised him to apply for bail at the High Court. Prosecuting, Mr Liberty Chimwaradze told the court that Chakauya approached a traditional healer and told him that his father was causing misfortune in his life and he was hindering him from amassing wealth. The traditional healer, the court heard, gave the accused a concoction to put into his father’s drink. Upon consuming the laced drink, the father fell unconscious bleeding from the mouth and nose and was rushed to Gokwe Hospital where he died upon admission. Chakauya left the court dumb-founded after pleading guilty to the offence and told the court he did it because his father was behind his misfortune. “I do admit to the charges of causing the death of my father,” he said. “I did it out of frustration because he was the one who was causing all the misfortunes I have been experiencing in my life.” Chakauya said he never thought the concoction would kill his father. “I was just taking the advice of a traditional healer who gave me the poison, which I then administered into my father’s drink resulting in his death,” he said.
