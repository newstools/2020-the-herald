The Herald Municipal Correspondent VICTORIA Falls municipality is now being run by two mayors belonging to the squabbling MDC-T factions, one led by Dr Thokozani Khupe and the other by Mr Nelson Chamisa. The mayors are Ward 9 councillor Somveli Dlamini who had been sacked by Mr Chamisa’s faction before being reinstated by Government on the request of MDC-T secretary-general Mr Douglas Mwonzora. Newly-elected Ward 5 councillor Richard Mguni is the other mayor who was reportedly elected under unclear circumstances. The elections were conducted despite the municipality’s management having insisted that they be deferred pending finalisation of Clr Dlamini’s case. Clr Dlamini said elections held to elect Mr Mguni were illegal and the process was flawed. “I did not resign as mayor of Victoria Falls as purported by some quarters and I don’t intend to do so,” he said. “I am still the bona fide mayor of Victoria Falls. “The resignee has to put his or her notice of resignation in writing to the town clerk as provided for in the Urban Councils Act, section 103 (3) (iii). That was not the case in my situation. “I was reinstated by my parent ministry on the orders of MDC party. With all this I want to put it clearly that I am the legitimate mayor of Victoria Falls.” Clr Mguni yesterday insisted he was the rightful mayor. “For now, I am the only mayor and I can say Clr Dlamini is wrong to claim as such,” he said. “I am actually at council offices now doing my duties. I am not fighting with him. He is my brother and we grew up together in Victoria Falls.” Asked who was running the municipality, town clerk Mr Ronnie Dube refused to be drawn into the matter. “At the moment, l cannot comment as the issue is in the public domain,” he said. Mr Mwonzora recently informed the Minister of Local Government and Public Works that the party had reversed Clr Dlamini’s recall.
