The Herald The rand firmed early yesterday alongside other emerging market currencies as more countries eased coronavirus lockdown restrictions, boosting investor appetite for riskier assets. At 0730 GMT yesterday, the rand was 0,25 percent firmer at R18,28 per dollar versus a close of R18,33 last Friday. European countries such as Spain and France, which have been hit hard by the virus, have announced a phased easing of lockdown measures as death tolls decline. Some Asia-Pacific nations, which have a relatively smaller number of cases than European countries, are taking similar steps as well. Risk appetite has picked up since the United States reported fewer job losses than expected last Friday, with the rand clawing back ground as investors seek value in risk assets that have hit oversold territory.â€” Reuters.
