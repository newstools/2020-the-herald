The Herald VAYA Logistics has launched VAYA Express Shopper, a free personal shopping service that allows customers to identify and pay for the groceries they want in a shop, and a dedicated ‘express shopper’ does the shopping for them, and delivers it to them. According to VAYA Logistics, the free service will be available to customers in Harare and Bulawayo up to May 17, 2020 when the current lockdown is scheduled to end. VAYA Logistics and Clean City CEO Mr Lovemore Nyatsine said: “We have a part to play in ensuring that the Covid-19 pandemic is curbed in these early stages. So we are introducing VAYA Express Shopper as your own ‘personal shopper’ who will go out and buy your groceries for you, and you simply pay for the groceries from the comfort of your home, while the express shopper delivers it to you. It’s absolutely free, there is no delivery charge.” Mr Nyatsine said the service would be open to all citizens in Harare and Bulawayo, and delivery would be assured within 24 hours. He said the VAYA Express Shopper offer also extended to all purchases made on the Ownai online Market Place, adding that customers purchasing groceries on the online site would also enjoy free deliveries until May 17. “For this offer we are not dictating to customers which supermarket they should purchase from – as long as it is within Harare or Bulawayo. Customers can purchase groceries from their favourite supermarkets, then simply call us on 166, and we will pick up the groceries and deliver them to their doorstep,” Mr Nyatsine said. — Herald Business.
