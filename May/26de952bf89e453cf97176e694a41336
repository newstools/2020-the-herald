The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal legend Ian Wright has revealed a flurry of disgusting racist messages sent to him on Instagram, admitting the abuse “still hits him so hard.’’ The 56-year-old, who also played for Crystal Palace and West Ham during his 15-year professional career, took to Twitter to share three screenshots of sick messages sent to him online by a user called Patrick O’Brien. In the seemingly unprovoked attack, Wright was labelled a “f***ing monkey,’’ a “n****r’’ and a “cotton picking’’ black man. Wright was also told: “If I get corona I will cough in your face and give you your death sentence. “If I see you I will put you on your death bed.’’ In another section of the abusive rant, which was sent to Wright via a direct message on Instagram, the user wrote: “I hate you. I hate your mom. I hate your dad. I hate your brothers and sisters. I hate all your family.’’ Along with screenshots of the messages and one of the profile responsible — which has now been removed — Wright expressed his sadness that he is still dealing with racist abuse 20 years after hanging up his boots. The former England striker tweeted: “I know I’m not meant to look at them but these messages still hit me so hard man. This is a child!’’ Wright also appeared to take a swipe at Instagram for allowing users to send vile messages online. He continued: “You are a f***ing monkey,” “C**t c**n monkey, n****r.” Direct message to me from Patrick O’Brien on IG. “This kid has a direct line into me and is able to send this without any worry.’’ Police have offered to investigate the incident, with the Metropolitan Police Service Contact Centre replying to Wright’s tweet to ask if he wished to report the abuse officially. In another rant, the popular pundit was told: “R9 Ronaldo will always be better than you, just know that. And he ended his career early with an injury. But will always be better than you.’’ Wright was no stranger to racism during his time as a player and has spoken openly about his experiences in the Premier League. In February, the Match of the Day pundit predicted that racism in football would never be full stopped, particularly with the growth in social media. He told BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs: “With the emergence of social media, you can see (racism) happening. “I don’t think it’s something that’s ever going to go away. “People feel that if you’ve been a victim of it you’ve got the answers, but you don’t know (what to do). “You look at people who are accused of racism, they’re older people — people who should know better. “I still think that education is key and that’s all we can do. But you’re just hoping that more and more people will out it when it happens. “Then you need the proper kind of discipline and punishment so that people understand that it’s not acceptable.’’ Meanwhile, the Premier League says it has listened to the objections of some clubs to the use of neutral grounds if the season resumes and will support them in putting those views to the authorities. Chief executive Richard Masters said the organisation was in an “ongoing dialogue” with government, police and ground safety officials. “Everybody would prefer to play at home and away if at all possible, and it’s clear to see some clubs feel more strongly about that than others,” he said after a shareholders’ meeting. “We are in contact with the authorities and listening to that advice, while also representing club views in those discussions.” He said “a really strong collective will to complete the season remains” but admitted that “curtailment” of the season was discussed for the first time at the meeting. Two weeks ago clubs were told neutral stadiums were the only way the season could be completed, because authorities were concerned about fans congregating outside home grounds and breaching social distancing rules. But at least six clubs are opposed to the proposal in the Project Restart plan, with Watford, Aston Villa and Brighton coming out publicly against it. Those clubs now want the chance to show they can deliver home and away matches safely, and league bosses are behind them. “Since Covid became an issue we’ve been talking to the authorities about the conditions in which we could get the Premier League back up and running and taking all that advice on board, but it is an ongoing dialogue,” said Masters, speaking for the first time since the season was suspended. “But all must be cognisant of what authorities are telling us, and we’ll continue with that consultation.” The government is understood to have “open ears” regarding neutral venues and is prepared to discuss the matter. ‘’However, a final decision is likely to rest with the police and ground safety officials, who have to grant licences to venues. Last week the head of the UK’s football policing unit, deputy chief constable Mark Roberts, said clubs opposed to neutral grounds should “get a grip”. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson also told the BBC he feared thousands of the club’s fans would gather outside Anfield to celebrate the title, even if matches were played at neutral venues. However, recently retired West Yorkshire chief superintendent Owen West told the Guardian that the use of neutral stadiums had “no rationale”, and such a proposal was not being enforced in Germany where the Bundesliga hopes to resume this weekend. Despite mounting tension and division over the use of neutral stadiums, Masters said Monday’s five-hour meeting showed a “strong desire to discuss everything in the round, and to agree a collective way forward”. He insisted a “really strong collective will to complete the season remains”. But he also admitted than a cancellation of the season was discussed for the first time.— Mailonline/BBC Sport.
