The Herald Just when you thought things couldn’t get any worse for the rand . . . they probably won’t. The currency slumped to a record low against the dollar in April, roiled by a slew of bad news: an ever-widening fiscal gap and soaring government debt; credit-rating downgrades leaving the country deep in junk territory; expulsion from a major bond index tracked by trillions of dollars of funds; and the implosion of the economy amid a strict coronavirus lockdown. But there are signs the bad news is priced in, and the rand may be poised for a rebound as emerging markets recover from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. These charts show why. The rand’s tentative recovery from a record low of 19,35 per dollar is encouraging options traders to prune bets on further losses. — Reuters.
