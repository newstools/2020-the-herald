The Herald Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter HARARE City Council say they have covered ground in their refurbishment of Rufaro and Gwanzura in their bid to bring the stadia to required standards. Rufaro was condemned by ZIFA while Gwanzura was abandoned by the top clubs about five years ago. Although the facelift was briefly affected by the lockdown, the city fathers say they have covered a lot of ground. “The lockdown affected the Council’s ability to finance the works due to a sharp fall in revenue as well as increases in COVID-19 related expenses,” the Council said on their Facebook page.. However, for Gwanzura, the Council said, there has been remarkable progress after they completed the upgrading of the sewer line. “Internal deblocking and enhancement of drainage complete,’’ the Council said. “Preparation of playing surface, in terms of levelling, complete. Turf has been bought awaiting laying. “Borehole drilled, solar fittings installed to ensure 24/7 water supply. “Designs for new changing rooms, doping and press rooms done, bill of quantities compiled and requisitions to procure materials raised. “Procurement process underway.’’ Demolition of old toilets has also been done with new designs undertaken. The council said they are working on purchasing the material and commence work on the ablution facilities. All the renovation work at Gwanzura had been scheduled to be completed by end of June before the timelines were affected by the lockdown. As for Rufaro, the Council said they had been good progress. Although they had expected to have completed working on the playing surface, and the boreholes, by the end of May, the lockdown delayed their mission. The levelling of the ground is now at 80 percent complete. “Solar panels for borehole installed on roof of western grand stand,’’ the Council said. “Designs of new changing rooms, doping and press rooms to conform with CAF requirements underway.’’
