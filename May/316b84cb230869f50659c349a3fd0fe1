The Herald Rumbidzayi Zinyuke Manicaland Bureau MUTARE City Council and the Department of Social Welfare will identify 1 300 vulnerable families who will benefit from a grant that has been set aside to alleviate hunger as the country fights Covid-19. The programme, which is being carried out in collaboration with development partners, will be implemented over the next six months. Speaking on the sidelines of a workshop held to sensitise and capacitate councillors and community health care workers on Covid-19 management and prevention, Mutare town clerk Mr Joshua Maligwa said identification of beneficiaries should begin soon. “As City of Mutare and the Department of Social Welfare, we have to identify 1 300 families who will be getting a monthly allowance of US$15 for the next six months to help them as we go through this fight against Covid-19,” he said. He said councillors and community health care workers would play a pivotal role in the identification of beneficiaries. Mr Maligwa said the sensitisation workshop would equip them to deal with all matters that could arise during and post Covid-19. “We have partnered with Unicef and Action Zimbabwe to train councillors, council staff and community health care givers who will be working in the communities. These are the people who will identify beneficiaries and help us tackle the challenges that arise during this period,” he said.
