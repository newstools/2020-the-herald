The Herald With everyone at home due to social distancing, various literary organisations and children-focused media houses are being creative about ways to entertain children and families stuck at home because of the lockdown. Penguin Young readers, Random House Children’s Books and PBS Kids are partnering in a special collaboration to launch Mondays with Michelle Obama. The limited run show features former First Lady of the United States of America, Michelle Obama, reading children’s book classics aloud via live stream. The series kicked off on April 12 with Michelle Obama reading the Grufalo by Julia Donaldson and illustrated by Axel Scheffler. The live streams come on at 5pm GMT. You can catch the next two live streams or simply head over to PBS youtube channel to watch recordings of past streams. Monday, May 11, 2020 at 6pm: The very Hungry Caterpillar.
