The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter NGEZI Platinum Stars speedster Michael Charamba would have missed the better part of the opening half of the season had the 2020 Premiership football term got underway in March. Charamba suffered horrific knee injury in a league match against Chapungu at Ascot in August last year. He subsequently missed the rest of the season as he needed surgery. The winger would have missed, at least 10 weeks of the first half of the season, had the marathon started in March. “The injury I suffered last year was quite something else. It was a blow to my progress,’’ he said. ‘‘I was also set to miss part of the first half of the season, if the term had started in March.’’ “The knee injury was so delicate and needed a careful operation procedure. I am glad, the delay in the start of the season has afforded me the opportunity to fully heal. ‘‘And, when the season is finally allowed to commence, I should be fully fit. As I speak, I am now almost 100 percent and cannot wait for the season to be allowed to start.’’ “Injuries are part of the game but they stall progress.” Charamba was also set to miss the CHAN finals, which were supposed to be held in Cameroon from April 4-25. With the tournament, reserved for only players plying their trade postponed indefinitely, Charamba now hopes he will make the grade. “First things first, I have to work very hard to wrestle back my place at Ngezi Platinum,’’ he said. ‘‘I should also help the team to be a dominant force and everything else will fall into place.’’ ‘‘I didn’t think I would be back feeling fit again. I have been in an unwanted situation but I am glad I am back. Now is the time to work.” Charamba said he has largely been inspired by teammate Qadr Amini, who suffered a similar injury in 2018 but bounced back in the second half of the 2019 season.
