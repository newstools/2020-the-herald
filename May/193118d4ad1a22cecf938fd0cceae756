The Herald Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE Cricket have taken the lead in the fight against coronavirus by engaging on a countrywide disinfection programme of cricket facilities. The authorities yesterday started the ball rolling at Harare Sports Club, Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo and Mutare Sports Club. Zimbabwe Cricket spokesperson, Darlington Majonga, said the rest of the grounds and facilities will be disinfected and cleaned in the coming days. Disinfection of the facilities is one of the requirements outlined by the Ministry of Sports in their comeback strategy. Cricket has been classified under the low risk sport codes and might come back earlier when compared to the high-contact sports like football and rugby. ZC acting managing director, Givemore Makoni, told The Herald on Saturday this week cricket has a clear strategy for resumption of games. “We have followed the Government protocol and we will remain under lockdown until such a time we are told it’s safe to resume cricket. “We must ensure the safety of the players, officials and supporters. So, ZC have a proper protocol to be followed on how we intend to come back after the lockdown. “We have procured sanitisers and disinfects, with the help of ICC, to disinfect the grounds. “Maintenance has been going on at our grounds like the Harare Sports Club and Queens Sports Club. We had a reduced staff working under strict social distancing protocol,” said Makoni. ZC have also been involved in the fight against coronavirus through awareness campaigns aired via digital and electronic platforms. The association has sourced material that include disinfectants, sanitisers, gloves and vitamin C tablets to be distributed to Wilkins and Thorngrove hospitals. Two orphanages in Harare and Bulawayo are also set to benefit from the association’s social responsibility programmes.
