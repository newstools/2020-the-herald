The Herald Africa’s largest mobile operator MTN says data was one of its main drivers of revenue growth in the first financial quarter, as the country was placed under lockdown to curb the growth of the coronavirus pandemic. The mobile operator recorded a 26,4 percent  jump in data revenue in the Q1 which ended March 31. Revenue from voice was down 6,3 percent, while fintech grew 26 percent. “The impact of the pandemic on our quarter one performance was not significant as lockdown restrictions for our consolidated subsidiaries were only implemented from the last week of March 2020,” said CEO Rob Shuter. Digital revenue increased by 15,6 percent. Demand for broadband has increased sharply since the country was put under lockdown, with companies making employees work from home in a bid to mitigate the spread of the pandemic. — fin24.com
