The Herald LONDON. — England all-rounder Ben Stokes “would do anything” to get cricket back on television, whether there are fans in the stadiums or not. Cricket, like most other sports, has been brought to a standstill by the coronavirus outbreak, and playing “behind closed doors” has been mooted as one way sport can return. England have already had a home series against the West Indies — which was initially scheduled for June — postponed, with the three Tests likely to be played at a later date, albeit without fans in the stadiums. While some believe the lack of supporters at sporting events will detract from the spectacle, Stokes is confident the players will retain their competitive edge. “Think about it, we are walking out to represent our country, we got Three Lions (England badge) on our chest and there is a game that we are supposed to win,” Stokes told BBC Radio 5 Live. “So whether it’s in front of nobody or, like we are used to, in front of a full crowd, I don’t think it’s going to take that competitive side away. “It’s a completely different scenario to get our heads around, that there isn’t going to be the atmosphere or cheering that we’re used to when we play an international game. “We would do anything to get cricket back on the TVs and for people to follow and watch. If that means you have to play in front of nobody then so be it.” — AFP.
