The Herald LONDON. — Derek Chisora will help Alexander Povetkin prepare to take on his old world heavyweight boxing rival Dillian Whyte. Zimbabwe-born Chisora shared two memorable battles with Whyte but has revealed he will travel to Russia to aid the downfall of his former opponent. “I’ve already said to Povetkin that, if he needs me, I’ll come and help him. I’ll fly to Russia,” Chisora told The Boxing Show on Sky Sports. “He said that he’d get me a private jet to come. Povetkin is my boy.” Asked what he expects Whyte’s reaction to be, Chisora said: “I don’t care. “The Russian has already spoken to me and said: “When it’s time I’ll send a plane to pick you up and you can help me train’’. “I’m down for that.” Whyte hit back: “It’s Derek being Derek. He’s good at talking his way into an ass-whooping. The first time he said it was close. The second time I cleaned his clock. The knock-out I gave him was one of the worst you will see in boxing. “I ain’t got no beef with Derek. I’m cool with the guy but clearly he has a vendetta. “Derek is a stepping stone and I’ve stepped over him twice already. If he wants to be brutally knocked out again I’ll take some easy money! If he beats Oleksandr Usyk and there’s a belt on the line, I’d gladly take the belt off of him.” Chisora was on the wrong end of a split decision in a brutal back-and-forth fight with Whyte in December 2016, after a fiery build-up where he threw a table at their press conference. Whyte knocked Chisora out in a rematch two years later but the British heavyweights could meet again. “It is going to happen,” Chisora said. “The United Kingdom would want to watch that again. — Sky Sports.
