The Herald Unions want Labour Court to halt SAA retrenchment process. Unions the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa and the SA Cabin Crew Association have approached the Labour Court in a bid to have Section 189 retrenchment notices issued by South African Airways’ business rescue practitioners declared unlawful. The deadline for unions to accept the BRPs’ proposed termination of employment agreement had been 17:00 on Friday May 1. The two unions, which together form a majority representation at the state-owned airline, filed an urgent application in the Labour Court in Johannesburg last Thursday. — fin24.com
