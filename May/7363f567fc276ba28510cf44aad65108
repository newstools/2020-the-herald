You all donated your time and trusted that we could pull off this ambitious task. Thank you! We hope this compromising of your brands will not stop you from working with us in the future,” he noted. “To the amazing corporates that at such short notice threw their weight behind us, we salute you and hope to build together with you in future endeavours. To our technical team that broke their backs, banks and had to work wearing masks and gloves every day for eight days straight during lockdown with meagre resources — you are heroes! “To our stakeholders in Government and our arts regulators, thank you for believing in the youth, in the arts and in big hairy audacious dreams. And to the public, the ‘biggest show’ that we promised did not quite materialise, we apologise sincerely. “The good news is that we managed to capture everything we had hoped to capture and the show will be on YouTube for all to watch amazing Zimbabwean talent and still donate to the cause of fighting Covid-19.”
