The Herald Court Reporter A gamble by a Mashwede Holdings bookkeeper to take advantage of a recent robbery at the firm to cover up a theft of $300 000 worth of fuel coupons and US$8 950 cash backfired when a customer raised a complaint over coupons. Mashwede Holdings recently lost over US$100 000 and R42 000 to five workers who allegedly connived with armed robbers. Taking advantage of the theft, Edson Mashamhanda (27), allegedly told management that in addition fuel coupons amounting to 23 000 litres, which he had already diverted to his own use, had also been stolen in the robbery, resulting in the company blocking the numbered coupons. But one customer, who had bought the blocked fuel coupons, but failed to get the fuel, approached the company seeking clarity. This prompted an investigation which found that Mashwede Holdings had been duped of $300 000 worth of fuel coupons and US$8 950. Mashamhanda appeared in court last week before magistrate Mr Richard Ramaboa charged with theft of trust property. He was remanded out of custody to June 3. The court heard that his duties involved receiving, recording and despatching fuel coupons after printing. According to the prosecution, Ernest Madanhire was entrusted by management to collect 40 000 litres worth of fuel coupons from Laptime Printers in March and handed them over to Mashamhanda for safekeeping. The serial numbers ran from 42851 to 44000. Mashamhanda allegedly diverted 23 000 litres worth of these fuel coupons to his benefit keeping 17 000 litres to the company, the court heard. Madanhire later found a buyer who wanted 6 000 litres of fuel and asked for the coupons from Mashamhanda, who gave him part of the batch. After selling the coupons to David Clinton for US$7 500, Madanhire handed over US$6 900 to Edson for safekeeping after deducting his commission of US$600. It is alleged Mashamhanda converted the money to own use. Mashwede Holdings balanced its books and discovered that 23 000 litres of fuel coupons reported to have been stolen were never entered into the books by Mashamhanda. Further to that, Mashamhanda was given US$2 050 after the sale of fuel coupons on the previous batches by one of his workmates, Muvengwa Changamire, which he never remitted to the company. This prompted a report to be made to the police, leading to his arrest. Mashwede Holdings suffered a total prejudice of $300 000 in missing fuel coupons and US$8 950, which Mashamhanda received and failed to account for.
