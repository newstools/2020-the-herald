The Herald Sikhumbuzo Moyo in BULAWAYO THE ZIFA Referees Committee have assured their members the association is processing the disbursement of the $2 000 bailout they promised the match officials. The money is meant to assist the referees during the ongoing national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Early this month, ZIFA announced, following a meeting of their emergency committee, a resolution to pay $2 000 to each of their top 80 referees. The association also undertook to pay the Sports and Recreation Commission levy on behalf of their 24 500 registered athletes and officials. ZRC chairperson, Bryton Malandule, said all was in place and their members should not panic, indicating ZIFA could probably start depositing the money any time this week. “It’s work in progress, I checked with our office guys who assured us that any time the referees will start receiving the payout. “We haven’t forgotten about that pledge, which is unprecedented by the way, but we just felt that since some of our referees were not gainfully employed, and with the game in limbo, it would be humane and prudent to assist them. “We are also running online courses to keep the referees abreast and they will need to buy data for all these things. “I can assure them that all is in order,” said Malandule. He is also a member of the ZIFA executive committee.
