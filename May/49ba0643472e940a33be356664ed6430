The Herald Herald Reporter Police have launched a manhunt for a Lupane traditional healer, accused of raping a pregnant client during a “healing session”. The man fled after the 18-year-old victim filed a report with the police. The woman, from Nyamandlovu, had visited the traditional healer for assistance. Upon arrival at the man’s homestead, she was ushered into one of the rooms where she was raped. National police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi confirmed the incident in a statement. He warned traditional healers against raping clients. “Police are looking for a traditional healer on allegations of raping a pregnant woman who had visited him for help,” said Asst-Comm Nyathi. “He invited her into the house and raped her before releasing her. “He immediately dismissed the woman saying she was already healed. He also threatened the woman against disclosing the rape.” Asst-Comm Nyathi said the woman went back home where she informed her employer of the case. “Police are warning traditional healers not to take advantage of their clients,” he said. “Investigations into the matter are still in progress.” In a separate incident, a 28-year-old Bulawayo woman was raped while climbing up a mountain for a prayer session. An unidentified man pounced on her and raped her before disappearing in the bushes. “Recently, a Bulawayo woman (28) was raped in a bushy area near Emganwini,” said Asst-Comm Nyathi. “The victim was going to a mountain for prayers and the alleged rapist emerged from the bush and assaulted her with an empty beer bottle before raping her.” Most recently, a 22-year-old man from Mayo, in Manicaland Province, was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl.
