The Herald Nyore Madzianike Senior Arts Reporter Chegutu-based gospel music couple, Pastor Isaac and his wife Rosemary Muchaita, said it was important for artistes and men of the cloth to give back to the community during the current Covid-19 crisis. Pastor Muchaita said they have been working on various projects to assist the less privileged in their area to ease hardships that many have been experiencing because of the pandemic. He urged fellow musicians and pastors to remember their fans and followers that support them in good times with gestures of goodwill in trying times. “We have identified people within our community that need assistance and we are providing what we can to assist them. During good times, such people follow our music and support our ministries. It is our role to make sure they are assisted in this crisis,” he said. The singer-cum-preacher said they have also taken the time of lockdown to perfect their work in studio. They have almost completed their forthcoming third album “Jehova Muchengeti” due for release in three weeks. “We are currently in the studio finishing up our album which should be out in three weeks. I did six tracks with my wife is doing the other songs. “In fact, I can say my wife did half of the album whilst I did the other half. It is all about gender equality.” He said “Jehova Muchengeti” is inspired by the desire to take the word of God to people. Pastor Muchaita, who is a minister in Deeper Word Ministries together with his wife, said church leaders should continue praying for God’s deliverance from Covid-19. “Our main message is that even in hard situations, God protects and is the guider. He is the answer,” he said.
