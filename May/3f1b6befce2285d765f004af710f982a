The Herald Mobile operator Vodacom Group reported a 8,9 percent rise in annual earnings yesterday, buoyed by an improved second-half performance in its domestic market and the sustained growth of its international businesses. Headline earnings per share (Heps), the main profit measure in South Africa, for the full-year ended March rose to 945 cents from 868 cents a year earlier. Vodacom, which is majority owned by Vodafone, declared a final dividend of 405 cents per share. The company said it will be postponing the issuance of medium-term targets, “until such time that we have more clarity on the economic outlook and the effect on our business and operations over the medium term.” Group revenue rose by 4,8 percent to R90,7 billion, with group service revenue up 5 percent. “The past year has been characterised by strong customer growth — we now connect 116 million customers across the group, including Safaricom — and the benefits of prudent portfolio diversification,” Group chief executive Shameel Joosub said in a statement. —Reuters.
