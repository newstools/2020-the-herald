The Herald Impala Platinum estimates that 6 percent of production volume was lost at its Rustenburg operations after mines were placed under care and maintenance ahead of the Covid-19 national lockdown. In a third-quarter production report up to the end of March, the company, which also has mines in Canada and Zimbabwe, said its geographical spread had allowed mining production to continue at varying degrees during lockdown periods, adding that its focus for the rest of the year would be on reducing excess processing stockpiles to secure cashflow. “The implementation of the lockdown is estimated to have resulted in a 6 percent reduction in reported milled tonnage from each of Impala, Marula and Two Rivers,” the report said. The reduction is the equivalent of around 26 000 ounces of mine-to-market concentrate production during the quarter. Implats’ attempt to return to production landed the company in hot water earlier this month, leading to the arrest of the executive of its  Rustenburg operations, Mark Munroe, for allegedly violating lockdown rules. — Reuters.
