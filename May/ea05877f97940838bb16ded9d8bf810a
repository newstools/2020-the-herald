The Herald ROME. — Italy’s Serie A football teams have been given the green light to resume group training, but will have to wait until 28 May to know whether the season can resume, Sports Minister   said on Tuesday. Spadafora told Italian television that government scientists had accepted the Italian football federation’s revised health protocol. “The Scientific Technical Committee have approved the FIGC protocol for the resumption of team training,” Spadafora told Rai. “It is excellent news, collective training can now resume. “The FIGC have reviewed its first proposal with clarifications on the quarantine time in case of a positive test, but above all the famous initial self-isolation is avoided.” Spadafora said he has slated a meeting on May 28 with FIGC president Gabriele Gravina and Lega Serie A chief Paolo Dal Pino to decide on the return to competition. “We will then decide if and when Serie A will restart,” he said. — AFP.
