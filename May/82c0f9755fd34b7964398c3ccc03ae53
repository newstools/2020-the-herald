IT feels like being bowled out for a duck.
The pain, the dejection, that long walk back to the dressing rooms. That’s what the Lady Chevrons could be feeling after the International Cricket Council this week announced the postponement of the ICC Women’s World Cup qualifiers. The qualifiers for the 2021 ICC Women’s World Cup, in New Zealand, were set for Sri Lanka in June. But, they were postponed as a precautionary measure against the spread of the novel coronavirus. That means, for the second year running, the Lady Chevrons will not be taking part in any World Cup qualifier. Last year, they paid the prize for Zimbabwe’s ban by the ICC and missed out on the chance to play in the Twenty20 Women’s World Global qualifiers in Scotland. Lady Chevrons coach, Adam Chifo, said they understood the ICC decision to postpone the World Cup qualifiers. “For this postponement, that’s certainly the best thing,’’ said Chifo. “Health is what matters, at the end of the day. We play sport when we are well and those spectators also have to be well if they are to enjoy sport. “There is no need, definitely, to risk lives for the game. “As a team, we are devastated, to say the least. We would have wanted to take this team together but by the time we will be able to play in the ICC Women’s World Cup qualifiers, the composition will be different. “We will be nurturing other young players to come and fill the gaps left by seniors who would have retired.” The Lady Chevrons had been camping in Bulawayo since the start of this year, playing over 15 One Day friendly Series against local clubs. They only broke camp after the authorities imposed a nationwide lockdown in March. “We keep on hoping. One day, all shall be well and we cannot despair. This is a delicate period we are in. “We ought to respect the health guidelines. “So, we have drafted individual home workouts for the players. They are doing well, I should say.”
