This includes the movement of demonstrators, their associates and subsequent location of the trio at Muchapondwa Business Centre,” Asst Comm Nyathi said. He reminded the nation that abuse of social media is a serious offence and those caught on the wrong side of the law will be prosecuted. “Meanwhile, police are concerned with the abuse of social media platforms by some members of the public. Some are even using cellphone lines registered in fictitious names to abuse state officials among other criminal acts. “Members of the public are warned against the practice and offenders will certainly be brought to book,” he said. Government said information gathered shows the case emanated from a demonstration that was staged in Warren Park. “The three were part of a group of MDC youths that defied the lockdown laws in the country and took part in an illegal demonstration in Warren Park. While police were looking for them, social media chatter indicating the three had disappeared was observed. Measures were put in place to locate them. On the night of the 14th, the police were informed that the three suspects had been located at Muchapondwa Business Centre in Bindura,” reads the statement.
