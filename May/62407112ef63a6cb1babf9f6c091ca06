The Herald The ongoing tobacco ban is setting back transformation in the business environment and severely impacting black farmers and businesspeople, lobby groups have said. Government has “done a deal with the devil”, in refusing to lift the ban on cigarette sales during Level 3 of the national lockdown, the Black Tobacco Farmers’ Association said on Monday, adding that black tobacco farmers had “suffered enough”. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the BTFA —which represents emerging black tobacco farmers across the country — said it was “deeply disappointed” by the ongoing ban. “In fact, we struggle to find words to explain how disappointed we are. “Our farms are dying, and our livelihoods with them. An entire black-owned, transformed sector of the agricultural economy is going to die. And it is entirely the government’s fault,” said the association. In an address on Sunday evening, President Cyril Ramaphosa said following consultation with various bodies, Cabinet decided the whole country would move to lockdown Level 3 as from June 1. Limited alcohol sales would be allowed, but the cigarette ban would remain in place due to health risks. — fin24.com
