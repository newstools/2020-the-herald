The Herald Panashe Chinyemba and Joseph Nyamande
On Saturday March 21, 2020, the First Choice Pvt College (Waterfalls) and First Choice College (Highfield) prefects held a leadership workshop co-ordinated by Trymore Nyamapfeni. In the first session we learnt about the characteristics of a leader. We discovered a whole new philosophy behind leadership that taught us that a leader is there to inspire and not give orders. One of the presenters acknowledged the qualities of his former headmaster from 1997 – Mr Kingstone Rudhenya – and the everlasting mark he made in his soul. He highlighted that a leader should be like that – remembered for humility and character-changing traits even decades after one met them. The session ended when it had gathered momentum and things were becoming more and more interesting. The second session was about us and what we had learnt and what made us think we could be good leaders. In the final session, we broke down the word “LEADERSHIP”. We treated the word as an abbreviation of a true leader’s characteristics. But what we mainly got from the session was the fact that a true leader should be honest and faithful in even the little things. We quoted Luke 16:10 which says: “One who is faithful in a very little way is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little way is also dishonest in much.” A leader is supposed to be honest in everything he or she does despite the fact that they are being seen by others or not. This is because self-honesty comes first before it is recognised by those being led. Leadership is also about forgiving others. To conclude the amazing activity, famous actor Zolile known as Tsotsi from Wenera shared words of encouragement. After that a photoshoot marked the end of the day as people wanted to capture such a memorable event. True leaders were born that day.
