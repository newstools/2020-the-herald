Stakeholders in the arts industry have implored the Government to avail grants and loans, which are easily accessible to artistes to help them fight the effects of Covid-19 pandemic. The remarks were made during a discussion focusing on the industry and its practitioners during and after the current health crisis. The discussion took place on social media last week as a collaborative effort between National Arts Council of Zimbabwe and Unesco. Regional director and representative for UNESCO regional office for Southern Africa Professor Hubert Gijzen, who was one of the panellists, gave examples of how other countries are helping their artistes and also highlighted various examples of how other players in the creative industry are coping with the crisis. He gave reference to United States singer Lady Gaga who raised millions of dollars with her online show “Global Citizen” which had many musicians joining, urging Zimbabwean artistes to follow such initiatives. NACZ director Nicholas Moyo said they are working with UNESCO and have taken note of all points. He appreciated all stakeholders, artistes and general local fans who came on board. “We are very grateful to UNESCO for allowing us to have this platform. We are going to take all the debates raised up and come up with solutions. We have the statistics of artistes and funds will be distributed fairly,” said Moyo. Culture Fund of Zimbabwe executive director, Farai Mupfunya said there are a number of issues that should be considered in devising ways to assist artists. “Have we checked what other countries have done on helping artistes? Are the policies favourable? We also need to look at intellectual property rights. It is a good opportunity now to revisit their(artistes) lifestyles and have a new thinking. We have to go back to principles of solidarity,” he said.
