Employment plunged in April after the government imposed a 40-day lockdown in a nation of 1,3 billion people, forcing businesses to shut and pushing up the jobless rate to 27,1 percent in the week ended May 3, surveys by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showed. Daily wage workers and those employed by small businesses took a massive blow, according to CMIE.
