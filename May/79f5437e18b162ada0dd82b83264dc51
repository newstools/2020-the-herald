The Herald Robson Sharuko Senior Sports Editor THE Guinness Book of Records have confirmed the PAKAANGU Miracle has spilled into their corridors, opening a window for them to look at all the data, and establish whether it can be listed as a first in the 131-year history of league football in the world. Ghanaian sports journalist Nuhu Adams, one of the leading figures in the coverage of African football in the world, believes PAKAANGU is not only a first, in the history of the game, but an incredible development. Rob Harris, considered an authority on African football given his extensive coverage of the game for the Associated Press, says he will take a very close look at the rare phenomenon. PAKAANGU unfolded in the domestic Premiership between 2010 and 2013 when four straight league championship races were decided through goal difference. The name PAKAANGU is a creation of this newspaper and is derived from the first two letters of the surnames of the four coaches who featured in the gripping drama. Callisto Pasuwa, Joey Antipas, Kelvin Kaindu and Rahman Gumbo were the major players in the drama with the Dynamos gaffer winning three straight league championships during the period. Antipas won one of the league titles, in 2010, when he fought off a fierce challenge from the Glamour Boys, with the Mighty Bulls securing the only championship in their history. Zambian gaffer Kaindu was the unfortunate man, with his Highlanders twice losing the championship race, in 2012 and 2013, on goal difference to their biggest rivals DeMbare. The Herald has launched a campaign for this rare phenomenon to be included in the Guinness Book of Records and the FIFA archives as a first in the history of the game. Records broken in African football have, generally, not been given the same prominence, or acceptability, as events in European or South American football. This was highlighted by the way the late Zambian legend, Godfrey “Ucar” Chitalu, was denied recognition, despite scoring 107 goals in 1972, while Gerd Muller of Germany was considered the record holder with 85 goals scored in the same year. <img class="size-full wp-image-485318" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/KELVIN-KAINDU.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/KELVIN-KAINDU.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/KELVIN-KAINDU-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Kelvin Kaindu Lionel Messi was then celebrated as the record goal-scorer in 2012, after scoring his 86th goal of the calendar year against Real Betis. This weekend, the Guinness Book of Records confirmed receipt of the material sent by this newspaper. “Thank you for getting in touch, we aim to answer all correspondence within 3 working days but a representative will be in touch as soon as possible,’’ they said. But, Ghanaian journalist, Nuhu Adams, was sure it’s the first time it has happened. “Never happened anywhere,’’ he said. “That’s incredible, I don’t think there will be any (similarities in world football). “For four consecutive times, with the top two clubs finishing the season with same number of points, (that’s) amazing.’’ But, for local football fans, there has never been anything like this and they have their fears. “This story will not gain global recognition, which it should in all accounts, just as that Zambian great striker (Chitalu) who outscored LionelMessi is not recognised,’’ tweeted Stephen Africa. “It seems we are facing an unAfrican system.’’ <img class="size-full wp-image-394075" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/Rahman-Gumbo.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/Rahman-Gumbo.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/09/Rahman-Gumbo-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Rahman Gumbo Another football fan, Michael Kaliika, could only say, “this is a brilliant article, hopefully Guinness Book of Records respond to your enquiry’’. Remarkably, in 2012, Bosso could not win the championship, despite starting their campaign with a 23-match unbeaten run, and only losing once all season when they fell 0-3 to Monomotapa at Rufaro. A 7-1 thrashing of neighbours Quelaton at Barbourfields highlighted their sheer class and they remain the only local side to fail to be champions after only losing one league game all season. They beat both CAPS United and FC Platinum home and away but their two Battle of Zimbabwe showdowns against DeMbare ended in identical 1-1 draws. But, nine draws, including three against their Bulawayo neighbours Quelaton and Chicken Inn (two) proved to be their Achilles Heel as just one victory in those matches might have meant gold for them. PAKAANGU also appeared to be hostile to the former Bosso sons, who were coaches during that time, with Gumbo’s FC Platinum being overtaken by DeMbare in dramatic fashion in 2011. They led the Glamour Boys by a dozen points when Pasuwa was brought in with as many games to go after a 0-1 defeat to Blue Rangers at Rufaro ended Lloyd Mutasa’s time as coach. But, the Harare giants enjoyed a stunning turnaround of fortunes under Pasuwa and by the time they arrived at Mandava, for the penultimate match of the campaign, they had crept within striking distance of the leaders. However, FC Platinum had all the aces, needing just a draw at home to virtually seal the title race but an own goal by defender Daniel Vheremu turned the season on its head. The Glamour Boys went top, by virtue of a superior goal difference, and a comfortable 2-0 win over bottom club Kiglon Bird ensured FC Platinum’s 3-1 win over Shooting Stars counted for nothing. <img class="size-full wp-image-458364" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/ANTIPAS.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/ANTIPAS.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/ANTIPAS-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> Joey Antipas In 2013, DeMbare would receive a helping hand from an unlikely ally, CAPS United, on the final day of the season. Harare City were primed to be champions and the club even invited all the city fathers for what they believed would be the Mother of All Parties, at the National Sports Stadium, on the final day of the season. With a two-point lead, after Silas Songani had inspired them to a 4-0 thrashing of Highlanders at Rufaro in Round 29, Harare City were odds-on favourites to be champions. But, CAPS United fought like a club battling for the title and a 2-2 draw, in that final match at the giant stadium, meant that Dynamos’ routine 2-0 win over Black Mambas at Rufaro gave the Glamour Boys the title. The strange ending that afternoon was highlighted by some CAPS fans, booing their players, for turning on the style, as they supporters favoured a conclusion in which DeMbare were not champions. Incredibly, Harare City even finished third, overtaken by Bosso on the final day, as three clubs ended with the same number of points (54) with the Glamour Boys taking their third straight league crown. Bosso were the highest scorers that season with 45 goals but the 27 they conceded proved to be their undoing as, for the second year in a row, they lost the crown on goal difference.
