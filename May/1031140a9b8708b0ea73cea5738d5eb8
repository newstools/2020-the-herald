The Herald MANCHESTER. — Pep Guardiola has given his backing to the bid to bring back the English Premier League football. The Manchester City boss is still mourning the tragic loss of his mother to the coronavirus almost a month ago. But he has told club bosses that he is committed to the plan that will see the season resumed on June 12 – if the government gives its approval. Guardiola understands better than anyone that Premier League chiefs must tread carefully in their efforts to finish the season while the coronavirus pandemic continues to kill hundreds of people in the UK every day. A senior City source confirmed: “Pep will be in charge of the team when the season restarts. “This is obviously still a traumatic time for him and his family – but he took a lot of comfort from the messages of support he received after his mother passed away. “He has been having conversations with players, his coaching staff and (director of football) Txiki Begiristain and is putting things in place in readiness for the proposed return. “The hope at the club is that football can play a role in helping the country to return to some kind of normality.” Guardiola was devastated when his 82-year-old mum, Dolors Sala Carrio, passed away in Barcelona on April 6. Spain has been one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic and only Madrid has suffered more fatalities than Catalonia. Guardiola (49) has donated £920 000 to the Angel Soler Daniel Foundation to help with the purchase of medical equipment. City are one of the clubs behind the mission of both the Premier League and UEFA to complete the season. Even with the backing of owner Sheikh Mansour, the Blues face losing more than £100million if Operation Restart fails — and that would threaten the jobs of scores of non-playing staff. City were the first club to announce that they would not be putting workers on furlough. But the social and economic consequences of voiding the season would be harsh. — The Mirror.
