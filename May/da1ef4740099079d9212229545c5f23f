BLACK Rhinos Queens have made it a policy to recruit players from disadvantaged backgrounds. The women’s football team scouts are usually out of town, searching for talent from children’s homes, rural and farming communities. The army club, usually take on board those who normally don’t have experience. And, for a good reason, too. This is how stars like Mavis Chirandu, who was plucked from Bindura, Sibusiwe Chipindura of Guruve, Zhombe’s Cathrine Mukwananzi, Tariro Teterai from Honde Valley joined this club. And the rewards have been incredible for the military team. They have won all the nine league titles since the inception of the National Women’s Soccer League back in 2010. Club secretary-general, Panganai Mahachi, said his team’s thrust, to give an opportunity to the talented but underprivileged players, has been their secret weapon over the years. “Obviously, it’s not easy to string together consistent top-class performances that has seen us winning the championship at every turn,” Mahachi said. “All other teams, each and every season, will be planning on how to dislodge us from the summit. “But, our policies are consistent and really rewarding. “What we do looks very simple at face value but it’s really hard. We go out of our way looking for talented players from the disadvantaged members of the society.” Mahachi said, with the help of physical, technical and mental experts at Black Rhinos Queens, the players, who naturally want to fight off poverty, are then converted into polished products. “Mind you, I said we take them from poor backgrounds. They naturally want to use football as a way out of poverty. “That drive helps up their fighting spirit. And, we have all the experts who will help transform them from raw talent into polished gems.’’ In a league that also has competitive and resourced teams like Mufakose Queens, Herentals and Harare City, Rhinos have a record that will be difficult to break.
