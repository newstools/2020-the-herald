The Herald Herald Reporter A Harare man, who allegedly offered auditing services through his unregistered company, Guide Accounting Services, appeared in court yesterday after he was accused of failing to offer auditing services despite being paid more than US$39 000. Tafadzwa Guide Motsi appeared before Harare magistrate Barbra Mateko on fraud charges after he failed to do ZIMFIT Tyres’ books properly. Motsi was not asked to plead to the charges and was remanded to August 8 on $1 000 bail. Allegations are that on July 4, 2017, ZIMFIT Tyres director Tatenda Mahachi incorporated his company under the Companies Act. In October of the same year, Mahachi engaged Motsi and his company to do his company’s accounts. The court heard that Motsi and his company offered auditing services to ZIMFIT Tyres between October 2017 and December 2019 and was paid US$39 440. In December 2019, Mahachi went through his financial statements and discovered that there were some errors. Mahachi then went to make enquiries at the Public Accounting and Auditors Board and was told that Motsi and his companies were not registered and were also not allowed to practice. He lodged a complaint with the police leading to Motsi’s arrest. Mr Sebastian Mutizirwa prosecuted.
