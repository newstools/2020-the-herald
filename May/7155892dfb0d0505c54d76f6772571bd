The Herald Minneapolis, Minnesota, US. — The city of Minneapolis woke up yesterday to billowing smoke and widespread damage in its southern districts after a night of rioting over the death of George Floyd, a black man pinned down by a white police officer. The area around the Third Precinct Police Headquarters became the focal point of anger with shops and building sites set ablaze, looting and clashes with police. The mass outpouring of anger marks the third day of protests as people demand justice for Floyd’s death. The man’s family have called for the Minneapolis officers, now dismissed from the force, to be charged with murder. One fatal shooting was reported near the protests area, but the circumstances remained unclear. The protests continued as the Justice Department announced that the investigation into Mr Floyd’s death was a “top priority”. The 46-year-old died on Monday after being detained by officers and pinned to the ground. In a video shot by a witness, one officer is seen pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes even as he was heard pleading “I can’t breathe.” The incident and the video has triggered accusations of racism by police and sparked protests in Minneapolis and Los Angeles this week. Under pressure, the Minneapolis Police Department fired the four officers involved in Floyd’s arrest. However, his family and local officials want to see murder charges. The victim’s sister Bridget Floyd told NBC that the family is looking for Justice. “I would like for those officers to be charged with murder because that’s exactly what they did,” Ms Floyd said. The cause of death hasn’t been revealed and the Minneapolis police have so-far not released bodycam footage of the arrest. The incident has rekindled anger, especially in the African-American community, of racism and police brutality, especially against black men. — N-News.
