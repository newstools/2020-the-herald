The Herald The easing of lockdown regulations as some countries start to reopen their economies has provided a welcome boost to the rand. That, and the decision by ratings agency S&P last week to keep the country’s credit rating unchanged, according to analysts. The local unit strengthened as much as 5,2 percent last week. It continued its rally opening at R17,57/$ on Monday morning, strengthening to as much as R17,53/$ before trading at R17,67 by late afternoon. The rand has been the second-worst performing currency after the Brazilian Real, having weakened more than 20 percent for the year to date. Just weeks ago, analysts were predicting the currency would test the R20/$ mark, as they anticipated large capital outflows as much as $14 billion on the back of the rand falling out of the World Government Bond Index, due to Moody’s downgrading it to junk status. But this has not yet happened.  On the contrary, appetite for SA portfolio assets has not died down, Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop noted in a rand report. — fin24.com
