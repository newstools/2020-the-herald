The Herald TURIN. — Juventus director Fabio Paratici has said transfer target Paul Pogba will struggle to find a club willing to match his wages at Manchester United due to the financial impact caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The World Cup winner has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford, although sources told ESPN United were optimistic he will remain at the club beyond the next transfer window before the sport was halted by the coronavirus pandemic. Pogba left United for Juve in 2012 before returning to Manchester in a then world-record £89.3 million transfer, and while the Bianconeri are keen to have him back, Paratici warned the impact of the coronavirus means few clubs will be able to sign a player on such a high salary. “He [Pogba] is a great player but he will struggle to find someone who can pay his wages,” Paratici told Sky Sport Italia. Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane is also keen on signing Pogba, though sources have told ESPN the club’s hierarchy would prefer to pursue other targets. Several clubs have said their summer transfer plans will be affected by the impact the virus has had on the game, which has seen 2019-20 seasons in Belgium, Netherlands and France cancelled. However, United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has said his side could “exploit” the transfer market due to their financial strength in comparison to many of their rivals. Pogba won a Serie A title in each of his four seasons at Juve, but has failed to challenge for the Premier League since returning to Old Trafford. He has won a League Cup and Europa League with United and has been left “frustrated” following an injury-hit campaign before the enforced break due to the coronavirus outbreak.— AFP.
