The Herald Herald Reporter PRESIDENT Mnangagwa yesterday sent a condolence message to the Mavima family following the death of Sekuru David Zirirai Mavima, father to Minister of State for Midlands Provincial Affairs Larry Mavima. Sekuru Mavima succumbed to cancer of the colon at a hospital in Harare on Tuesday. “Although we had been aware of his illness for some time, our prayers and wishes were that he would be healed and well again,” said President Mnangagwa in a statement last night. “Sadly, this was not to be as he passed on shortly after his admission to hospital.” President Mnangagwa described Sekuru Mavima as a hardworking man who inspired a lot of people. “Sekuru Mavima lived an exemplary life, diligent and hardworking man, a family man, towering father figure who inspired those around him, especially his children, grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren to excel in whatever they set out to do in life,” he said. “He will be sorely missed by everyone who got to know him and benefited from his wise counsel. On behalf of Government, my family, and indeed on my own behalf, I wish to express our deep condolences to the Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Midlands Province, Cde Larry Mavima and the Mavima family, Sekuru Mavima’s grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren, in their darkest hour of grief. We mourn their great loss together. “May his soul rest in peace!”
