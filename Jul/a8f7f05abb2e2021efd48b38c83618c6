The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE late director of newly-promoted ZIFA Northern Region Division One Soccer League side, CUMA Academy, Hurbert Manyowa, was laid to rest at Kadoma Jewish cemetery yesterday. Manyowa, (48), committed suicide on Tuesday after a domestic dispute. ZIFA Northern Region Division One league chairman, Martin Kweza, said they had lost someone who wanted to make a difference in the league. “The passing on of CUMA co-director, Manyowa, is a great loss to the Northern Region Soccer League family and the football fraternity at large,’’ said Kweza. “Football has lost a rising young cadre who many believed would change the face of the game in Kadoma. “Through our brief interactions, I was impressed by the vision and plans they had for the team, together with his colleague Cuthbert Malajila. “He was humble and had football at heart. It’s so sad that he died before he could fulfil his dream of bringing Premier League football back to Kadoma. “It’s even more painful that we never got to work with him and benefit from his wide knowledge of football matters. We urge his colleagues to help see the dream through. “At this moment, our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and the players and the community who also looked up to him. May they find comfort in the Lord.’’ Former Harare City striker, Osborne Mukuradare, who grew up in Kadoma, said they had lost a father figure. “It is painful that we lost someone we all looked up to here in Kadoma as he would help anyone,’’ said Mukuradare. “I grew up here and they are our elders who supported soccer from grassroots with his academy. “I would come and help his side whenever I was free and he was a very good man. We have lost a pillar of strength.’’ Manyowa co-owned CUMA Academy with former Warriors forward, Malajila, and their side was recently promoted into Division One.
