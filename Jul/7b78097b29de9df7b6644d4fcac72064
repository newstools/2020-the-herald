The Herald Masvingo Bureau A serial drug dealer is not only going to jail, but will be a pedestrian when he comes out as he has lost the car he was driving to ship a tonne of dagga as part of his sentence. Michael Mzembi (37) of Mucheke suburb in Masvingo, was slapped with an effective 10 months behind bars after more than one tonne of mbanje was found stashed in his car, which was forfeited to the State. The mbanje was also confiscated. Mzembi was convicted of illegally dealing in dangerous drugs at the end of a full trial before magistrate Mr Mboni Ndlovu on Wednesday. Prosecutor Mr Malvern Mapako told the court that on 8 October last year, at around 11 am, a crack team of police officers from ZRP Masvingo Central received a tip off that Mzembi, who has previous convictions for drug peddling, was dealing in dangerous drugs. The police went to his house and found 1 053kg of mbanje in his car.
