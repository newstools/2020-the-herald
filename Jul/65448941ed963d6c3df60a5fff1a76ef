The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter SHE starred in the 100 and 200-metre sprints but now Precious Mujuru, a certified elite fitness trainer and consultant, is now a proud owner of Shredded Gym. The 33-year-old, a Ms World Fitness semi-finalist, came into fitness by default after former Bodyfitness owner, Knox Mapfungautsi, pushed her to try it 10 years ago when she took part in the Ms Novice. The athlete now runs an online fitness consultancy, as a team building specialist for companies and organisations, as well as a weight loss consultant. “I started body building 10 years ago where I would compete in local shows,’’ she said. “I would say I was forced to jump on stage and compete in the Ms Iron Fitness but it latter became my passion. “Being a former national team sprinter in the 100m and 200m, I was always doing all kinds of training so my body was in top shape without me even noticing it. “Others saw it and pushed me to compete and I have always made the podium since then.’’ She excelled and won titles like the Miss Iron Zimbabwe, Miss Pro Fitness 2012, Miss Muscle Mania 2014, third-place in the Miss Zim Classics 2015, Miss Iron Zimbabwe 2015 and fifth place in the Miss Zimbabwe Figure. Mujuru took part in the World Fitness Championships in France and finished fourth at the Arnold Classic Africa in South Africa in 2015. The athlete said she is grateful to the National Federation of Zimbabwean Bodybuilding for giving her an opportunity to compete at the highest level. “The other memorable moment was when I was ranked 14th in the Ms World Fitness. ‘’I faced some challenges because I didn’t have enough knowledge of the sport and not having sponsorship.’’
