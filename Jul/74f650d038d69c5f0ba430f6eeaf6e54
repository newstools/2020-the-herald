The Herald Wall Street stocks were mostly down early yesterday, giving back some of the recent gains in a market that has appeared resilient despite surging US coronavirus cases. About 15 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0,7 percent at 26 103 78. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 0,3 percent to 3 171 12, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index added 0,2 percent at 10 451 18. Major US indices gained more than 1,5 percent on Monday, with the Nasdaq finishing at a fresh record, betting that continued stimulus from Washington and the trend of the reopening economy would more than offset rising Covid-19 counts in Texas, Florida and other US states. But analysts said the early pull-back yesterday suggested the rally was losing steam. Investors are beginning to focus on the upcoming second-quarter earnings period, which begins in earnest next week. Companies in the S&P 500 are projected to suffer an average 43,8 percent drop in profits during a period devastated by coronavirus shut-downs, according to Factset. â€” xinhua.
