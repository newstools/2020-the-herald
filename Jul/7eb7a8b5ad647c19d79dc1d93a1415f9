The Mashonaland West Covid-19 response team has its work cut out tracing everyone who might have been exposed to the virus after two workers at the Chinhoyi branch of the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC) tested positive last week. Provincial Acting Medical Director Dr Gift Masoja said the response team was faced with a mammoth task in tracing all contacts, as the two workers used public transport to go to work. “We are tracing for people that were in contact with a worker at the ZNFPC’s Chinhoyi office who recently tested positive,” he said. “Although people who were close to her including workmates have since been tested, we are faced with a huge challenge of contact tracing.” Dr Masoja said one of the workers contracted the virus from her husband, who is now in Harare receiving medication for renal complications. Their child also tested positive. Speaking to The Herald, ZNFPC’s provincial manager, Mr Geshema Madzingaidzo, said the branch had since suspended operations at the clinic so that the premises could be thoroughly disinfected. “Fourteen workers were tested last Friday and are currently in self-isolation waiting for results,” he said. With the clinic suspending operations, people in need of family planning services have been advised to approach council and Government health institutions where ZNFPC supplies contraceptive products.
