The Herald Volkswagen has paid out €750 million  in settlements to German dieselgate customers With more than 240 000 cases in Germany concluded, Volkswagen paid out more than €750 million  (US$842 million) to customers in settlements, the German car-maker announced on Tuesday. With the transfer of money, the settlement of the dieselgate scandal, which was reached in the course of a class action lawsuit in Germany, had “essentially been concluded,” Volkswagen noted. An online platform on which German customers can submit their claim for compensation is scheduled to close on July 6, according to Volkswagen. A few thousand cases were still being assessed or processed. The agreement was reached with more than 90 percent of the cases in Germany in which claimants were entitled to a settlement, according to Volkswagen. In February, Volkswagen and the Federation of German Consumer Organisations had finally agreed on a compensation settlement in the dieselgate class action lawsuit. Customers received between €1 350 and €6 257, depending on the vehicle type and model year. However, Volkswagen is still confronted with lawsuits from tens of thousands of people who have chosen to sue individually in Germany. — xinhua.
