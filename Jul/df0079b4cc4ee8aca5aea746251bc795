The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter A  call from a Simba Bhora official, during this lockdown, could have shattered veteran footballer, David Redhiyoni. After all, he had just been rejected by the ZIFA Northern Region One newboys. But, instead, the 35-year-old said it has just inspired him to keep fighting on to find another club. Having played in the PSL for 13-years, the midfielder turned out for Grain Tigers in the second-tier league last year. A championship winner with Gunners, Redhiyoni has also played for CAPS United and ZPC Kariba. And, he just wants to keep playing. “I went for trials with Simba Bhora and made the shortlist and I was expecting to be part of the team,’’ he said. ‘’But, I was told I did not make it. It took me aback as I thought I had done everything to be part of the game. “I am a football person and some of these things happen and I believe very soon I will get a contract with some team.’’ Redhiyoni says he has been at home trying to find where he can open the new chapter in his story. “I feel I still have something to offer to the sport. I don’t want to retire any time soon as I feel I am still able to play at the top level. “I have played at the highest level for 13 years and, for me, it is an achievement and I still look forward to have another two to three seasons if injuries spare me. “I am working on my fitness so that when the lockdown is over I will be able to impress some teams.’’
