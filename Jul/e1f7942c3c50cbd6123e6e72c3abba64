The police have arrested 102 suspects for refusing to accept local currency as a legal tender. The arrests came under “Operation accept Zimbabwe currency as legal tender”, that was launched on Friday last week. The blitz comes after some people started rejecting notes written “bond note” based on fake news circulating on social media platforms. In a statement yesterday, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi warned traders and business entities that they risked being arrested if they refused to accept the money. “Since the onset of the operation ‘Accept Zimbabwe currency as legal tender’ on June 26, a total of 102 suspects have been arrested with 28 appearing in court in Harare,” he said. Asst-Comm Nyathi urged the public to report traders and businesses who refuse to accept the money. “Members of the public are urged to continue reporting to the nearest police station traders and businesses who contravene Section 3(2) as read with Section 4 of Statutory Instrument 175/2008 in terms of section 48 of Bank Use Promotion and Suppression of Money Laundering Act, (Chapter 24;24) (Number 2 of 2004),” he said. Recently, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa said traders were legally obliged to accept the Zimbabwean dollar. The Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) has since threatened to stop supplying their products to wholesalers and shops refusing to accept the local currency.
