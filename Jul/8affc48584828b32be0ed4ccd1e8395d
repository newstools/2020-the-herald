The Herald Sports Reporter MOTORSPORT Zimbabwe president, Ralph Stead, says they will continue working on preparing for the full resumption of their activities. The association is one of a number which were given the go-ahead to resume training and practice sessions only. “We were allowed to resume training and practice only, not full sports at this stage,’’ he said. ‘’We have a plan but they have allowed us to train and practice. “We have discussed this, obviously, we are working very closely with the Sports and Recreation Commission. ‘’Everybody is very keen to return into the sport and we will try and put together a calendar, we will, obviously, compress it. “I don’t think we are going to fit in all the events, what we might do is we might try and combine some disciplines into one weekend but they are basic plans in place.’’ It’s been two weeks since they returned to training and practice. “We have a very stringent programme, which we put together, in conjunction with the Sports (Commission) and we are making sure to implement (it). ‘’So all your precautions, temperature (checks), sanitising, (social) distancing and masks are all being implemented. “I think, the risk is pretty low because it’s out in an open area and people are not in close proximity. ‘’Once we start racing, we will address the issue of spectators, in accordance with what the Government will be asking us to do and what Sports and Recreation Commission will be advising us,” said Stead.
