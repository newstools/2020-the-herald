The Herald LONDON. — Roger Federer briefly thought about retiring from tennis but that has been put to bed and he is planning for next season, according to his long-time coach Ivan Ljubicic. The Swiss great was forced to call a premature end to his 2020 tennis campaign after he underwent two knee operations in the space of a few months. In an interview at the beginning of July, Federer admitted that he considered retirement, saying “I have had to consider if I really want to keep going (with my career)”. However, in follow-up interviews he vowed to make a comeback in 2021 and planned to play both at Wimbledon and the Tokyo Olympics. His coach Ljubicic though has also played down talk of retirement and says they are “positive” about next year. “Everything is under control. We are planning the next season,” he told Novi List. “It is a wish and a dream for everything to be like in 2017 (when Federer made a successful return to tennis following surgery), but it is clear that every situation is new. “Anyway, we have one positive experience, so we are all positive.” Ljubicic has been part of Federer’s coaching set-up since 2016 and insists he is fully committed to staying the course with the Swiss. However, he will switch focus to his sports management company, LJ Sports Group, when the former world No. 1 eventually calls it a day. “Roger will be my last coaching job. My commitment to this project (LJ Sports Group) after Roger is absolute,” Ljubicic said. — AFP.
