The Herald LONDON. — Frank Lampard said his Chelsea players had no time “to cry their eyes out” after their 3-0 English Premier League football defeat at Sheffield United on Saturday. The Blues began the day in third place in pursuit of a Champions League place, but could fall out of the top four today if both Leicester and Manchester United win their games in hand. David McGoldrick scored his first Premier League goal to give the Blades the lead and pounced again in the second half to seal a stunning victory after Oli McBurnie’s fine header had given them a 2-0 half-time lead. “You tend to learn more from tough moments and tough games,” Lampard said. “The most important thing is that collectively it is not (time) to cry our eyes out.” Lampard’s side had won five of their six previous Premier League matches, but were roundly beaten on their first visit to Bramall Lane in nearly 14 years. “They were better than us physically, better than us mentally, better with the ball,” Lampard said. “They were also stronger than us. With no crowd you can hear every voice. All I could hear were Sheffield United voices. “You know if you come here below par collectively, as we did, then something like this is going to happen. “We have to put this to bed and keep fighting to finish in the top four. We are still in that race because of what we have done this season.  — AFP.
