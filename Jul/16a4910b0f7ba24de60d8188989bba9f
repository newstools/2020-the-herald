The Herald Twitter confirmed on Wednesday that it hadlocked a number of high-profile accounts that were hacked to spread a crypto-currency scam. “We have locked accounts that were compromised and will restore access to the original account owner only when we are certain we can do so securely. This was disruptive, but it was an important step to reduce risk,” Twitter Support said in a series of tweets in the evening, adding that most functions had been restored but the company may take further actions. Twitter also confirmed the functional limitation for a much larger group of accounts, “even those with no evidence of being compromised,” while it continues the full investigation. According to the company, it has also taken “significant steps” to limit access to internal systems and tools while the investigation is ongoing. The accounts being hacked included technology company @Apple, ride-hailing company @Uber, Democratic presidential candidate @joebiden, Former president @BarackObama, Amazon co-founder @jeffbezos, Tesla and SpaceX founder @elonmusk, Microsoft founder @billgates, and renowned investor @WarrenBuffet. — Xinhua.
