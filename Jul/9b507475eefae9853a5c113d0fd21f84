The Herald LONDON. — Jose Mourinho claimed Tottenham Hotspur would be in the Champions League footbasll places had he been in charge all season after masterminding a “fantastic” victory. Tottenham defender Toby Alderweireld’s late winner on Sunday secured a 2-1 victory for Spurs, who leapfrogged above Arsenal to put themselves back on course for a place in the Europa League. But Mourinho, who took over as Spurs boss in November, said they would be even higher had he not taken over mid-season after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked after a poor run of results. He said: “Big credit to the players because they were really fantastic. What I asked for them tactically they gave me, what I asked from them from the emotional point of view, they gave me even more. They were fantastic. “I know I could look at in a selfish point of view and say since I arrived, if the championship started in that moment, even with all the problems we had I think we would now be fourth or fifth in the table. “I don’t want to be selfish, I don’t want to look at it just as a fan that is happy to finish above Arsenal. I would love to play Europa League. “It is not a competition I am in love with, it is not a competition I would like very much to play, but when you cannot play Champions League you play Europa League. “In my career I only played Europa League twice, and I won it twice. — The Mirrror.
