The Herald The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe yesterday extended, yet again, the curatorship for trouble money  lender, Lion Microfinance, to the end of this month. The financial institution was placed under curatorship of the  Deposit Protection Corporation (DPC) on July 26 last year due to  under-capitalisation and weak governance issues. The DPC in turn then appointed Mr Ngoni Kudenga of BDO Tax and Advisory  Services to manage the curatorship process. Continued extension signals challenges faced in the recovery process  for the micro-finance institution after the DPC last year said it was  focused on restoring the firm’s operations “in the shortest possible  time”. “Notice is hereby given that the curatorship of Lion Microfinance has  been extended by a further period up to July 31, 2020,” the central  bank said. “The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has similarly extended the appointment  of the curator, the Deposit Protection Corporation accordingly.” Curatorships are generally triggered by concerns about the management  or financial viability of the bank. — New Ziana.
