The Herald MANCHESTER . — Sir Alex Ferguson hailed Jurgen Klopp after the Liverpool boss was named LMA Manager of the Year. And he revealed that the German woke him up at 3am while celebrating the Reds’ English Premiership football title triumph. Klopp was selected ahead of last year’s winner Chris Wilder at Sheffield United and Gareth Ainsworth of Wycombe, who came third. Leeds United chief Marcelo Bielsa was in fourth place, recognised for ending their 16-year Premier League exile. But ex-Borussia Dortmund boss Klopp took the award after leading Liverpool to 99 points, dominating the top flight. Klopp and legendary former Manchester United boss Ferguson have grown close in recent years. The Reds chief still cherishes a breakfast meeting between the pair during the early years of his managerial career. “Jurgen, fantastic. I have spoken about Leeds United, 16 years in the Championship, Liverpool, 30 years since winning that league: incredible. “Really thoroughly deserved. The performance level of the team, really outstanding. “Your personality ran right through the whole club. I think it was a marvellous, marvellous performance. “I’ll forgive you for waking me up at half past three in the morning to tell me you’d won the league. Thank you. “But anyway, you’ve thoroughly deserved it, well done.” After receiving his award Klopp said: “I am absolutely delighted to get this title. “There are a lot of Liverpool names on this trophy – Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny looks like he is all over the trophy. Brendan Rodgers, too. “But the main name is Sir Alex Ferguson. I know it is not 100 per cent appropriate as Liverpool manager, but I admire him. “He was the first British manager I met and we had breakfast together – I am not sure if he remembers but for me it was like meeting the Pope. “I never thought then I would be holding the Sir Alex Ferguson trophy in my hands.” — The Mirror.
