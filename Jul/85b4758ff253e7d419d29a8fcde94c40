The Herald Oil prices were broadly stable yesterday, recouping earlier losses after rising US crude stockpile data and an increase in coronavirus infections in the United States cast doubts over a swift pickup in oil demand. Brent crude futures fell 1 cent to $43,07 a barrel by 0832 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped 8 cents to $40,54 a barrel. Both benchmarks are set for a fourth session of daily percentage changes of less 1 percent in either direction. The US coronavirus outbreak crossed a grim milestone of over 3 million confirmed cases on Tuesday as more states reported record numbers of new infections. US crude oil stockpiles rose last week, although gasoline and distillate inventories fell more than expected, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed. “Yesterday’s lull in price action in the oil market is continuing this morning even as sentiment is sullied by renewed US glut fears . . . the search continues for a catalyst to break oil out of its range,” said PVM analysts in a note. — Reuters.
