The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter Videographer and musician Simbarashe Gwati, affectionately known by his fans as “Simba Gee,” recently dropped a video for the song, “Chironzo”, which takes a dig at gender-based violence. Simba Gee said many men were abused in their marriages and suffered depression and emotional trauma but did not report the cases for fear of being seen as weak. The song, which is from his upcoming album titled “The Vintage Classics” has received overwhelming response from fans and is doing well on local radio stations and on ZTV. Chironzo has an atypical sungura beat which makes the listener want to hear more and the visuals have played a big role in popularising his song. His departure from the normal sungura outfits and video styles have brought a new feel to the genre. “I love sungura so much and I know people would say I am too young for that genre, but believe you me we are the next generation and now is the time to take over. I am working at revolutionising the genre bring a beautiful sound which just needs branding. We have greats in the genre like Nicholas Zakaria and Alick Macheso who are doing well and I am coming with a fusion of the genre,” he said. Simba Gee said the song serves as a solution and points out what is hidden in society about how the men are living with abusive wives. “Chironzo means worthless. So the song simply says love without respect is worthless. As you can see on the video, it is addressing the issue of gender violence. A lot of married men are suffering emotional abuse and cannot come out clear because they fear to be labelled weak by society. This is also my personal experience which I thought of converting into a song. We need to stand up for this as men,” he said.
