The Herald The National Social Security  Authority (NSSA) said yesterday it was giving temporary relief to  companies hard hit by the Covid-19 outbreak by allowing them to stagger  statutory monthly remittances that are due to the pension fund. Companies are obliged to remit monthly pension contributions to the  compulsory state-run pension fund. A significant number of companies were hard hit by the Covid-19 induced  national lockdown which the government implemented from the beginning of  April this year and which saw many firms temporarily ceasing operations. The failure to generate revenue during the lockdown in turn forced  firms to cut salaries and at worst retrench. The lockdown was meant to limit citizens movement to curtail the spread  of Covid-19 which has killed tens of thousands globally and infected  millions. To save local companies from the heavy financial obligations and give  them some breathing space to recover, NSSA said it would allow companies  to defer payments and would also suspend for three months, April to  June, penalties that are normally charged for late remittances. “The National Social Security Authority is pleased to advise employers  that it has put in place measures to assist organisations that may be  struggling to remit their monthly obligations due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic,” it said. To benefit from the relief, companies were, however, obligated to prove  that they were financially stressed, NSSA said. Granting of the relief measures was however not automatic. As part of the measures, NSSA said it had also deferred implementation  of new contribution rates that were meant to be effective from January  2020, up to end of June in light of the coronavirus outbreak. Contributions to the Accident Prevention and Workers Compensation  Scheme would however not be waived, even for stressed companies, for the  benefit of workers, NSSA said. – New Ziana
