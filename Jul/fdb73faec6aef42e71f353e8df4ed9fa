The Herald LOS ANGELES. —Tiger Woods will tee off alongside Brooks Koepka and Rory McIlroy at the Memorial Tournament this week, as the 15-time major golf winner returns to the PGA Tour for the first time since the novel coronavirus lockdown. The 44-year-old reigning Masters champion is one victory shy of a PGA Tour record 83 wins and last competed in February, before being sidelined with back issues. Woods has won the Memorial, one of the highest profile, non-major events on the PGA Tour, a record five times. Koepka will look to rebound after missing the cut last week at the Workday Charity Open, with McIlroy aiming to add another victory to his season after winning the WGC-HSBC Champions. The second of back-to-back events at Dublin, Ohio’s Muirfield Village, it also features the two most recent PGA Tour winners, Bryson DeChambeau and Collin Morikawa, plus Phil Mickelson, making his 20th start at the Memorial tournament. Meanwhile, the remainder of the 2019-2020 PGA Tour will take place without spectators as the United States battles a resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic, tournament officials said on Monday. In a coordinated announcement, the remaining tournaments on the schedule said they will not host fans due to concerns over Covid-19. All five tournaments held since the PGA Tour returned from its coronavirus shutdown in June have taken place without spectators. Fans had initially been set to be allowed at this week’s Memorial Tournament in Ohio but that plan was scrapped after a sharp escalation in coronavirus cases. — AFP.
