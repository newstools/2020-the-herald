AFTER getting an allocation of $4.8 million from ZIFA, the women Super League clubs will meet their leadership on Sunday to discuss the Covid-19 relief package. ZIFA yesterday said they have since distributed part of that money to the Super League clubs. “Covid-19 relief disbursements have been underway since Friday,’’ the association’s spokesperson, Xolisani Gwesela, said. “The ZWSL got its allocation of $4 875 000 while regions have started receiving their share. “More affiliates will receive their funds soon.’’ The clubs’ 14 top-flight clubs are expected to share $4 865 000. “Engagement was supposed to be done with football stakeholders first before disbursement of the funds,’’ said a club chairperson, who chose not to be named. “We have tried to engage our executive without any joy. “Mrs (Barbra) Chikosi (women football boss) referred us to ZIFA but she is our direct link with ZIFA. “We have resorted to a guessing game.” Another club chairperson said they have been invited to a meeting on Sunday by the women’s football leadership. “We have not received any communication to that effect that money has been deposited into the club account,’’ he said. “What I have been made aware of is that we must attend a meeting this Sunday. “I am confident that, at the meeting, we will give our input as clubs and then will be told how much will we receive from ZIFA.” Black Rhinos Queens, Herentals, Harare City, Weerams, Cosa Guruve, Cyclone Queens, Faith Drive, Auckland, Ngezi, Swallows, ZRP Harare, Correctional, ZRP Mambas and Hearts of Oak are in the Super League. New Orleans and Inline Academy, based in Bulawayo, are playing football at regional level and are also expected to get their slice of the cake. There will also be a share for the Mighty Warriors and the Young Mighty Warriors.
