The Herald LONDON. — Frank Lampard said Chelsea’s capitulation to lose 3-2 at relegation-threatened West Ham on Wednesday night is a sign of how much work he still has to do to make the Blues title contenders once more. Chelsea were on course to move third in the English Premier League football table when Willian’s penalty gave them the lead in the first half at the London Stadium. But the visitors did not learn from the reprieve they received from VAR when Tomas Soucek had a goal ruled out for offside as the Czech rose highest to level from another corner. Michail Antonio then put West Ham in front early in the second half before Willian’s free-kick brought Chelsea level once more. Lampard’s men then looked the more likely to claim all three points in the closing stages, but were caught on the counter-attack when Andriy Yarmolenko fired home a huge winner for West Ham’s chances of avoiding the drop. A 10th league defeat of the season leaves Chelsea just two points clear of Manchester United and Wolves in the race for a place in the top four and next season’s Champions League. “I wouldn’t say it is the story of our season because it’s been a good season, but there have been so many of these moments,” said Lampard, whose side had won all three of their previous matches since returning from English football’s three-month shutdown due to coronavirus. “The players in those moments have to show an extra mentality to see a game through like this when you have a lot of domination.” After a 2-1 victory over Manchester City last week that sealed the title for Liverpool and the signings of Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech, Chelsea have been touted as title contenders to City and Liverpool next season. “I’ve seen us play great games, but I also have seen opportunities to close a gap or move into third wasted. That’s the difference at the minute and shows how much work we’ve got to do.” — AFP.
