The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — The 26th annual SA Music Awards (Samas) will officially take place next month over five days. As Sowetan first reported last month, the virtually-produced Samas will air on pay broadcaster DStv — moving from their usual broadcast partner SABC. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced organisers, the Recording Industry of South Africa (RiSA), to scrap the big-budget glitz and glamour red carpet affair that stages in Sun City. “We look forward to the Sama26 virtual experience. Our teams are hard at work to deliver a show that we will all be proud of given the current state the world is in. I invite you all to tune in, plug in and do it for the culture,” said Risa CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi. The show will be structured over 30-minute episodes that will air between August 3 and 7. The episodes will broadcast on Mzansi Magic at 9.30pm; while also streaming on digital platform My Muze. “The South African Music Awards have always been a platform where talented Mzansi artists have been recognised for their excellence,” said Nomsa Philiso, the director of local entertainment channels at M-Net. “As a channel that has a track record of showcasing local talent across several platforms, we are very proud to be partnering up with Sama26 to give our viewers front-row seats to this virtual show-piece.” The curated show will feature two hosts with a line-up of special guest presenters, panellists and performers. — Sowetan.
