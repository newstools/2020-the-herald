The Herald LONDON. — Tottenham Hotspurs soaked up endless pressure, in the second half, and struck with just 10 minutes left to beat rivals Arsenal 2-1 in an English Premiership game last night. Defender Toby Alderweireld headed home the winner in the North London derby to help Spurs leapfrog their bitter rivals who had taken the lead through a beauty from Alexandre Lacazette in the first half. Son Heung-Min scored his first Premier League goal against Arsenal, in his 10th appearance, equalising just 137 seconds after the Gunners had opened the scoring. Arsenal are now winless in their last 27 Premier League away fixtures against other established top six teams. They have drawn 10 and lost 17 since a 2-0 victory at Manchester City on 18 January 2015. ‘’You cannot concede goals and make the mistakes that Arsenal have and expect to win tough Premier League matches,’’ BBC football pundit, Matt Upson, said. ‘’It could not be any better tonic for Tottenham at the moment. Their game plan was pretty good. They hit Arsenal in the areas they know they are vulnerable especially down the sides.’’ Alderweireld said it was a huge win for Spurs. “I think it’s massive for us. I think we really wanted to win this game, you know it’s difficult without the fans, it will be a totally different atmosphere but I think we did everything that we could. We fought. “I think we did have a little bit of luck to get three points today. “I think with the goal, because against Bournemouth, you missed a little bit of luck to get the last pass, so I think today we had the little bit of luck to get the 2-1.”— BBC/Agencies.
