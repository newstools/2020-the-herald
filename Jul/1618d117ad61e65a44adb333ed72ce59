The Herald Tendai Rupapa Senior Reporter Police have arrested another suspected thief believed to be part of a gang that broke into Jet Stores and another boutique in Harare and got away with goods worth $1 325 345 and US$13 640. The gang shared the loot and one of them, Jealous Phiri (34) took his share to Mvurwi Town Centre where he sold the goods including clothes, to shop owners. Phiri appeared in court on Saturday last week and was remanded in custody to today for bail application. His alleged accomplice Robert Mhandu is already on remand facing similar charges and was denied bail, while Trustme Kauzani is said to be still at large. According to the State, Mhandu was caught wearing some of the stolen clothes and driving the vehicle which they allegedly used as a getaway car. Phiri was not asked to plead to two counts of unlawful entry in aggravating circumstances when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Barbra Mateko. It is alleged that on June 12, Phiri and his alleged accomplices went to Jet Stores along Jason Moyo Avenue while driving a Nissan Sylphy. Upon arrival at the shop, the gang allegedly used an unknown object to break the display window and burglar bars before gaining entry. Whilst inside the shop, it is alleged that they stole various types of clothing items and other goods worth $1 325 345, which they loaded into their vehicle before driving away. Two weeks later, Phiri went to Mvurwi were he sold the clothes, the court heard.
