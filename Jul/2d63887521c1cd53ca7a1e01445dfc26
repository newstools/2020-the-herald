The Herald LONDON. — Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said Bruno Fernandes has brought a winning mentality to Manchester United after his brace inspired an impressive 3-0 win at Brighton on Tuesday night. Cajoled by the dazzling Fernandes, United produced one of their best performances of the season at the Amex Stadium. Mason Greenwood opened the scoring early in the first half and Fernandes doubled the lead before the interval. Fernandes netted again after half-time with a fine volley as United climbed above Wolves on goal difference to take fifth place in the English Premier League. “Bruno has come and been fantastic. He has brought that winning mentality with him, that 99 percent is not good enough. It has to be 100 percent,” Solskjaer said. “I’ve got more than one game-changer. The third goal was a great team goal. To see so many players sprinting forward to get on the end of it was fantastic. A great finish by Bruno.” With fifth place securing qualification for the Champions League if second-placed Manchester City’s European ban is upheld, United are in a strong position to return to the continent’s elite club competition. If they make it, United will owe a huge debt of gratitude to Fernandes, who has scored six goals since arriving from Sporting Lisbon in January. The Portugal midfielder’s role in revitalising United cannot be understated. They were mired in a major slump before Fernandes’ signing, but are now on a 15-game unbeaten run in all competitions, including three successive wins. “It’s a joy to watch them when you see them express themselves like that,” Solskjaer said. “The confidence comes from performances. They worked hard during the lockdown and we know we have loads to play for. “I don’t care about making a statement, I know we are a good team.” — BBC Sport.
