The Herald MANCHESTER. — Paul Scholes has backed Manchester United to still come through in their battle to finish in the top four, after they dropped points against Southampton. The United legend has explained why the 2-2 draw with the Saints at Old Trafford on Monday “didn’t really matter”, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side still able to determine their own fate in the final three games. United recovered from going a goal down to Stuart Armstrong’s strike, as Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial both netted fine first half efforts to turn the game around. But United lost control of the game in the second half, as left-backs Luke Shaw and then Brandon Williams both went off injured. United were then defending with 10 men and Michael Obafemi scored a late equaliser from a corner. But Scholes believes United will still finish in the top four this season. “I don’t think it’s changed that much,” he said, while working as a pundit on Premier League productions. “Obviously they would have liked to have won the game and get into the top three. . — Manchester Evening News.
