The Herald LONDON. — Manchester United beat Crystal Palace 2-0 to keep the pressure on Leicester after their top-four rivals defeated Sheffield United as the battle for Champions League football qualification heated up on Thursday. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side had no margin for error after Leicester’s 2-0 victory earlier in the day and they responded thanks to goals from Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. United’s fifth win in their last six league games leaves them in fifth place in the Premier League. They are level on points with fourth-placed Leicester, trailing them on goal difference, and one point behind third-placed Chelsea. “No one thought in January that we would be in with a shout for the top four. We have done fantastic since the restart,” Solskjaer said. “We didn’t get the rhythm in our passing but two fantastic goals won it for us. That is the thing at Manchester United, you have to step up and show your personality.” English Premiership Fixtures Today: Norwich City v  Burnley (6:30pm).
