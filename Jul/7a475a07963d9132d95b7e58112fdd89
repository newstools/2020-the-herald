The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — They always say behind every successful man there is a woman but for former Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Chancy Gondwe it was completely the opposite. Chancy Gondwe has revealed his regret about spending his money on alcohol and women during his stay in South Africa. Gondwe is now back home in Malawi, where he is a pastor, but has been looking back at his football career in the PSL with shameful memories. “I went to all the dirty nightclubs in Hillbrow, where after drinking you would buy a woman,” he told Kick.Off.com. Former Kaizer Chiefs midfielder, Junior Khanye, also revealed a few months ago how he used to pick up students at a university in Johannesburg to go on drinking sprees in nightclubs around Gauteng. Now, Gondwe has revealed his weakness for women during his career in South Africa. “The trouble is that when I got to South Africa, I continued with what I was doing in Malawi but here there were a lot of beautiful women,” says Gondwe. “For the first time in my life I saw five women walking together and all of them were beautiful, and I didn’t know which one to go for.” Gondwe has been sharing his stories about alcohol abuse, which almost led him to commit suicide. “I am being open because this is my testimony, plus I feel free talking to you about this,” said Gondwe. — KickOff.com
