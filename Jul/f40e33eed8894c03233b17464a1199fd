The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — The South African Premier Soccer League is considering whether they should cut their losses and cancel the rest of the season. According to a few club owners who attended last Tuesday’s board of governors meeting, the league’s leaders are engaging with all stakeholders — including sponsors and broadcasters — about the possibility of cancelling the 2019/20 campaign. PSL acting chief executive, Mato Madlala, laughed off the talk of ending the season now, but confirmed that the league’s chairperson, Irvin Khoza, was “talking to stakeholders”. “Like we said in our press release, the chairperson is currently engaging with all the stakeholders on the way forward,” Madlala told City Press on Friday. She confirmed the board of governors would meet again once these engagements were completed, but no date had been set for the resumption of the campaign. However, those privy to the discussions around the PSL’s efforts to restart play were adamant the season would be cancelled. — City Press
