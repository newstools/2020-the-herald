The Herald LIVERPOOL. — Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti believes his players must make a big leap forward if they intend to challenge for European football qualification next term. The Toffees are 10 points behind sixth-placed Wolves, but their experienced boss has called on his squad to take the leap of faith with him if they are to move to the next level. And in an admission which will hurt Everton fans, Ancelotti said today’s opponents Sheffield United were ideal role models. “I think we don’t have to take into consideration how big the jump. We have to jump,” said the three-time Champions League winner. “We have to move forward, we have to improve and try to be better next season. They (Sheffield United) did really well this season and it was a surprise for everyone. “Chris Wilder has done a fantastic job with this team, the players followed him. They can be a good example to follow. “It is not only the physical things. They have a clear idea to attack and defend and you see they are playing together.” One player Ancelotti will hope can make a big step forward is £27.5million striker Moise Kean. The 20-year-old joined from Juventus last summer with high expectations but has scored just one goal. He has managed to complete 90 minutes only once all season. Since January he has been on the field for just 163 minutes in 10 substitute appearances. And even with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison having contributed just two goals between them in the last nine matches, his chances of a start have looked slim. — AFP.
