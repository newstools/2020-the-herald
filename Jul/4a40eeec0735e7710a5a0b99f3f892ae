The Herald LIVERPOOL. — Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp admits he cannot spend “millions and millions” on squad reinforcements for his newly-crowned English Premier League football champions but does not believe he will need to. The effect of the coronavirus outbreak is likely to have a significant impact on transfer activity for the majority of clubs this summer but Klopp insists even if he had a significant war chest to spend, it would not necessarily be the easiest or right thing to do. Liverpool’s first league title in 30 years was achieved by a squad four years in the making and while the Reds boss will obviously look to strengthen — especially with the likely departures of fringe players Xherdan Shaqiri and Adam Lallana, to name two — he thinks it will be difficult to make significant improvements. The club have already stepped aside in deciding not to compete with Chelsea for the £50m signing of RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner. “Covid has of course influenced both sides with ins and outs, that is completely normal, and it’s just not likely that it will be the most busy summer in the world,” Klopp said. “But maybe at a later point in the year, if the transfer window is still open, we will know more. But this squad . . . look at it. “It is not a squad you have to change now and say ‘OK, we need this position and this position”. “We don’t have a first XI, I say we have a first 16 or 17, they can all play to the same level. But we have to use this, 100 percent. — Sky Sports.
