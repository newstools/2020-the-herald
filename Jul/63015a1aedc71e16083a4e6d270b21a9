The Herald LONDON. — Ben Stokes is making it difficult for England cricket team selectors to give him a break by consistently turning in stellar performances, coach Chris Silverwood admitted on Tuesday. All-rounder Stokes scored 176 and 78 not out as well as taking three wickets during the home side’s 113-run win over the West Indies in the second Test at Old Trafford on Monday. That performance took him to the top of the Test all-rounder rankings ahead of the third and final Test of the series, starting at the Manchester ground tomorrow. England, with the series tied at 1-1, could field three fresh fast bowlers in James Anderson, Mark Wood and Jofra Archer. The home side are wary of bowling their quicks into the ground during a punishing schedule of six Tests in seven weeks, with a Pakistan Test series to come. Despite a tight turnaround, it would still be a surprise if England chose to rest Stokes this week. “We want him out there as much as we can — everyone can see how good he is,” said Silverwood. “But you know what, we’re going to consider it (resting Stokes). “People come in and see how they work, how they train, not just from a fitness point of view, but also their work ethic in the nets.” — AFP.
