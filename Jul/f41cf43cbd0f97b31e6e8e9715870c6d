The Herald Court Reporter A HARARE man yesterday appeared in court facing accusations of conning another man of US$550 after passing himself off as a High Court prosecutor, who could facilitate a divorce. Berven Chipunza (32) appeared at the Harare Magistrates Courts charged with fraud or alternatively impersonating a public officer. He denied the charges when he appeared before magistrate Sheunesu Matova, who remanded him to July 17 for trial on $500 bail. Prosecutor Mr Owen Safuli said sometime in January this year Chipunza was introduced to Ngonidzashe Marau by his friend Francisca Mukanza. Marau, a Chitungwiza Municipality employee, wanted assistance in a divorce case, which was before the High Court. Accusations are that Chipunza told Marau that US$550 was needed for him to file a complaint with the judge and also take his pre-trial conference minutes to the court. Marau is said to have paid the money with Chipunza promising him that the minutes for his pre-trial conference will be filed with the court by the next court date.
