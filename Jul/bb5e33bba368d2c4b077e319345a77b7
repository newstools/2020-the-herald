A Harare-based building contractor has been summoned to court on allegations of duping a property developer, Pokugara Properties (Private) Limited of nearly US$1 million in a botched joint venture agreement to build houses in Harareâ€™s leafy suburb of Borrowdale. Georgios Katsimberis (54) is expected to appear at the Harare Magistrates Court on August 19, 2020 to answer to accusations of defrauding Pokugara Properties of US$883 728 after entering into an agreement to build houses at Dandaro Village in Borrowdale. Katsimberis, who is being represented by Mr Tendai Biti, will be charged with fraud. Katsimberis was supposed to appear before a Harare magistrate for trial on Tuesday, but the State opted to prosecute him on August 19 after furnishing him with papers to allow him to prepare his defence.
