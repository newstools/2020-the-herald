The Herald KINGSTON. — Bunny Wailer, who is admitted to a Kingston medical facility after suffering a massive stroke, has stabilised. The 73-year-old reggae singer has been at the institution since Monday last week. “He’s stabilised. And we’re going through what we have to go through, in relation to his recovery,” Maxine Stowe, the singer’s manager, told the Jamaica Observer yesterday. “The stroke affected his physical mobility; it didn’t affect his thinking. So I’m giving thanks he’s cognitive, so we’re just keeping him up spiritually,” she continued. Stowe said she is optimistic that the singer would be out of the hospital in maybe a week. However, rehabilitation would follow. “There’s a rehab centre that he’ll be spending another four weeks at,” she said. This is second stroke Bunny Wailer is experiencing in two years. Stowe said she is, however, prepared for the journey ahead. In May, Bunny Wailer was shaken by the disappearance of his partner of more than 50 years, Jean “Sister Jean” Watt. Watt, 70, who suffers from memory loss, has not been heard of since. The family is also offering a cash reward for her safe return home.  The Duhaney Park Police are investigating. Hailing from Trench Town, Bunny Wailer’s given name is Neville Livingston. He is a founding member of The Wailers, which included Bob Marley and Peter Tosh. — Jamaicaobserver.com
