The Herald The Coronavirus Infectious Disease-19 (Covid-19) pandemic has forced schools and universities to close their doors, impacting an unprecedented number of students globally. As a result, many young people are beginning to envision the future they want to see in the post-Covid-19 era because of the economic and social challenges they will face in the years ahead. In March this year, the UNESCO Office in Zimbabwe received a Global Partnership for Education (GPE) grant amounting to US$70 000  to support the Ministry of Education. The funds have been used for printing children’s story books and developing radio programmes. The Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, AB Communications and Zimbabwe Newspapers have partnered the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education in delivery of lessons initially for primary schools. But UNESCO has also unveiled a US$7 million Covid-19 grant, which supports five key areas in the education sector. The five areas are: Continuity of learning using multiple approaches such as radio, digital platforms and print materials; Training teachers on open and distance learning modalities to enable them to support children’s learning at home; Preparing schools for better and safe re-opening by developing guidance notes and information, education and communication materials; Providing sanitation and WASH to targeted schools; Developing a “teacher kit” with protective equipment, and providing psycho-social support to students and the most vulnerable children such as children in remote areas, children in special schools, girls and disadvantaged schools.
