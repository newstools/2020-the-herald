Last week, burglars broke into an irrigation company in Bulawayo and made off with US$23 500, R43 200 and $2 500 which was in a safe in one of the offices after disabling alarm systems and the closed-circuit television during the night. Part of the stolen cash was in a safe, while the other was in a drawer and when police attended the scene, they discovered that the burglars broke one of the windowpanes and cut the burglar bars to gain entry. Four armed robbers recently snatched US$80 000 in Bulawayo from a man believed to be a gold dealer, while he was in his car outside a city hotel. The 29-year-old man was in his Toyota Allex near the intersection of Joshua Nkomo Street and 12 Avenue, opposite a hotel when one of the robbers, armed with a pistol, jumped into his vehicle. The robber was then joined by his three accomplices and the four manhandled the victim demanding the cash. They later drove off in the Toyota with the victim, before dumping him in the city centre. A driver from a Bulawayo-based hardware company also allegedly lost US$30 000 to thieves while on the way to bank the cash after he stopped at a supermarket in the city centre to buy food, leaving the cash in an envelope on the dashboard. The driver had been sent by one of the directors of the hardware firm in Belmont. However, police were not convinced that the robber took place and suspected the driver faked it.
