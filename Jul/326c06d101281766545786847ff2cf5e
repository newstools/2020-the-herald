Former officer-in charge of Gweru CID, Detective inspector, Leonard Gwandu, was on Thursday jailed for an effective two years after being convicted of criminal abuse of office after he released a stolen vehicle. Gwandu released a vehicle stolen in South Africa that was being held by the police as an exhibit in December last year, without following procedures. He pleaded guilty. Gweru regional magistrate Mrs Phathekile Msipa initially sentenced him to three years before suspending one year on condition of good behaviour. For the State, Mrs Namatirai Chipere proved that on December 14 last year, Gwandu released a Toyota Hillux truck, which had been confiscated from local businessman Mr Shepherd Tundiya despite the fact that the car was being kept as an exhibit and should eventually be handed over to the South African police. Tundiya was arrested in connection with the stolen vehicle that he had bought, and had been acquitted. But there was no order to release the car in question.
