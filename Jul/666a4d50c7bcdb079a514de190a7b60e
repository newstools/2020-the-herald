FOREIGN Affairs and International Trade Minister Dr Sibusiso Moyo has challenged the country’s youths and surviving generations to emulate the “patriotism, humility and hard work” that was espoused by the late Cde Perrance Shiri. In a statement, Dr Moyo, a retired army general, described his late comrade-in-arms as a “respected military strategist, both compelling and charismatic in nature” and called upon the country not to only eulogise over his death but to emulate his sense of national duty. The late Cde Shiri died from the Covid-19 pandemic. He was 65. Dr Moyo said, although Cde Shiri is gone, Zimbabweans can draw solace and inspiration from his history that saw him leave school as a teenager to join the liberation struggle. “Cde Shiri’s patriotism, commitment to duty and the love he felt for Zimbabwe was absolute; from the day, aged 18, when he abandoned his studies to join the liberation war, and throughout his 47 years uninterrupted, dedicated service to the nation, never wavered, always placing the nation good ahead of personal interests. “His commitment, patriotism, result orientation and his desire for the efficacy of the civil service should be exuded by the youth and surviving generations. “Cde Shiri has indeed left us, but his enormous contribution and his indelible legacy as an icon of our struggle and as a tireless servant of the people of Zimbabwe will endure. He has curved his name in all our hearts. He is the National Hero par excellence, and we are definitely poorer as a nation without him,” said Dr Moyo. The late Cde Shiri died from Covid 19 early morning Wednesday, and people from different backgrounds have saluted his contribution to the country, first as a soldier and recently as the Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement.
