The Herald LAHORE. — Former Pakistan batting coach, Grant Flower, has apologised for his controversial remarks regarding the batting great Younis Khan. Flower had stated that Younis held a knife to his throat when he offered him batting advice, during a tour of Australia. “I apologise for my remarks regarding Younis Khan,” Flower was quoted as saying by a local news channel. “I gave that answer in response to a question, after the interview had finished, but I did not know that it would get so much hype in media.” The 49-year-old, Flower, a former Zimbabwean cricket star, had initially stated Younis, who is the Pakistan batting coach, was tough to master despite being the highest scorer in the history of the Asian giant’s Test cricket. “Younis Khan quite tough to master. Obviously, a brilliant career. I remember one incident in Brisbane, during the Test, at breakfast, I tried to give him a bit of batting advice, not that my career was anywhere near his regarding stats, as he is the highest scorer in Pakistan Test cricket,” said Flower. “But he didn’t take kindly to my advice and brought a knife to my throat, with Mickey Arthur sitting alongside, who had to intervene. Yeah, it’s been interesting. But that’s part of coaching. “It makes it a hell of a journey, and I’ve really enjoyed it. I’ve still got a lot to learn, but I’m very fortunate to be in the position I am.’’ Flower served as Pakistan’s batting coach in a tenure that started in 2014 and ended in 2019. — dailytimes.com
