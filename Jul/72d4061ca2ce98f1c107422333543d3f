The Herald LUSAKA. — Winger Ernest Mbewe says Zanaco must beat hosts Forest Rangers today in Ndola to send a statement that they are back in business. The Zambian top-flight league will today become the first major regional football league to restart after the coronavirus outbreak. The restart coincide with a key meeting between ZIFA and the PSL in Harare today where, among other things, they will discuss the possible start of the domestic Premiership. A number of Zimbabwean players ply their trade in the league. Unbeaten in the league, since Chris Kaunda took over in early January with seven wins and a draw, the seven- time champions headline the restart of the FAZ Super Division with a big test. Zanaco visit Levy Mwanaawasa Stadium to take on Forest who headed into the four-month coronavirus lockdown in pole position and harbouring dreams of a debut league title and maiden continental qualification. Forest enjoy a one point lead ahead of Napsa Stars on 46 points. Zanaco are down in tenth place and trail Forest by eleven points. “We are looking at getting a positive result against Forest but it is a must-win game, we are not looking at a draw because this game is a crucial game,” Mbewe said. “If we win, we will send a message that Zanaco are back in business, ok in football you draw, you lose but our objective is to collect the three points.  A draw will hit our morale but a victory will give us a big boost especially after this long break due to the lockdown.” The game is Zanaco’s first of four herculean rescheduled dates over the next fortnight with fourth placed Nkana next Wednesday in Kitwe, a tricky Lusaka home derby against Kaunda’s ex-charges Nkwazi on July 26, before wrapping up their backlog away against third placed and last season’s runners-up Green Eagles on July 29. — Sports Reporter/Lusaka Times
