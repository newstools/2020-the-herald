The Herald NEWCASTLE. — Jose Mourinho praised the “incredible” Harry Kane after the Tottenham striker passed 200 goals at club level with a double in Wednesday night’s 3-1 win against Newcastle in the English Premiership football match. The 26-year-old’s two strikes took his tally to 201 goals in 350 games, with all but 16 of those for Spurs. “Harry Kane knows how important he is, he is incredible,” said Spurs boss Mourinho. “After such a difficult recovery [from injury] he is playing every minute of every game, this is the fourth game with two days in between and Harry gave everything.” The victory took Spurs up to seventh and boosted their Europa League qualification hopes. It was also the first time Mourinho had won a Premier League game at St James’ Park in his eighth attempt. The visitors led in the first half when Son Heung-min drilled a low shot into the bottom corner moments after the drinks break disrupted Newcastle’s dominance. Dwight Gayle almost levelled when his header hit the post and Matt Ritchie blasted an equaliser home 11 minutes after the restart. But that parity only lasted four minutes as Kane headed home a deep cross from substitute Steven Bergwijn. That was the England captain’s 200th club goal, with 184 coming for Spurs and the other 16 for loan clubs Millwall, Leyton Orient and Leicester. He got the 201st late on with another header after Martin Dubravka parried Erik Lamela’s shot. It was an impressive performance from Newcastle, who managed 22 shots to Spurs’ eight, but their season is just petering out as uncertainty over their Saudi Arabian takeover continues. — BBC Sport.
