The Herald OLD TRAFFORD. — An explosive spell from Stuart Broad on the fourth evening kept alive England’s hopes of winning the second Test against West Indies at Emirates Old Trafford yesterday. Broad, who rested for the first Test, took three wickets in 14 deliveries with the second new ball to inspire the home side after West Indies looked to be batting towards a position of safety. Kraigg Brathwaite made 75 and Shamarh Brooks 68, but when Brooks was trapped lbw by Broad it began a slide from 242-4 to 260-8. Roston Chase’s 51 dragged the tourists past the follow-on mark, only for Chris Woakes to remove him and Shannon Gabriel in the same over to bowl West Indies for 287, 182 behind. The sight of Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler striding out to open the batting for England 40 minutes from the close was thrilling, evoking memories of the World Cup super a year ago. However, a chaotic eight overs saw Buttler fall for a duck and Zak Crawley 10 to leave England 37-2, leading by 219. They will continue the quest for quick runs today, setting up a declaration before looking to take the 10 wickets that would level the three-match series at 1-1. Pace bowler Jofra Archer, who was dropped from this Test for breaching the bio-secure protocols, returned to training by bowling in the nets. With the entire third day lost to rain and West Indies blunting England’s attack for most of the fourth, this match seemed destined to meander to the draw that would see the tourists retain the Wisden Trophy. — BBC Sport.
