The Herald LIVERPOOL. — Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti has injury concerns, which could give Aston Villa a boost, ahead of the two sides’ clash in an English Premiership match at Goodison Park tomorrow. The Toffees haven’t won any of their last three league games and their European ambitions look dead now barring an absolute miracle but they have to give their all in their last three games. Ancelotti was left frustrated after Everton’s 3-0 hammering at Wolves. Andre Gomes and Mason Holgate missed that game due to injuries while Yerry Mina had to be withdrawn midway through the first half at Wolves. Ancelotti claimed Mina’s injury was due to lack of recovery time during games and that he will be assessed today. If things go well, he should return to the squad tomorrow. Holgate and Gomes are also expected to be back for the game against Aston Villa. “Yerry had a muscular problem. Unfortunately, when you only have two days to recover, the player doesn’t recover properly and to have an injury like this can happen.” A full strength Everton side should be good enough to beat Aston Villa but with Dean Smith’s side fighting hard for survival, they will make things extremely difficult for the Toffees. — hitc
