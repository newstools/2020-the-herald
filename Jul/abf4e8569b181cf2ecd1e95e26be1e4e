THERE was a huge sigh of relief for local gym owners, and body-builders, after the Sports Commission announced the reopening of some gyms yesterday. Seasoned body-builder, Precious Mujuru, said she was happy with the work they have undertaken to see body-builders, and physical trainers, getting the green-light to open some of the gyms. “We fought a good war, most gyms are now open,’’ said Mujuru. “I am proud of the Gym Owners Association, which came together and pushed for the Ministry (of Sport) and Sports Commission to consider the re-opening of gyms. “Special mention goes to Austin Jeans, who was heading the team. “The opening of gyms means a lot to me as I was sadly watching the industry die, so, this means there is hope. “As an athlete, I can now set new goals and, although we cannot really talk about competitions this year, we can start preparations for next year.’’ She said she has been working hard, under closed doors, during the national lockdown. “I have been keeping fit, through road runs, home workouts and healthy eating,’’ she said. “To others, in the industry, let’s pick ourselves up again, it doesn’t matter where you are now but you can always get back in shape. “The fitness trainers should strive to get people fit and healthy again. If your gym is not open yet, just be a bit more patient and it will not be for long as there is underground work going on.’’ Meanwhile, former body-builder Victor Kunonga says athletes should continue working hard.
