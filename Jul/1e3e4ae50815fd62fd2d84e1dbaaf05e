CRANBORNE Bullets coach, Nesbert “Yabo” Saruchera, says his players are desperate to play in the domestic Premiership. The army side secured a ticket to play in the top-flight league after they won the ZIFA Northern Region Division One league title last year. However, seven months later, they are yet to kick a ball in the Premiership. “We are still under lockdown but the players are doing well in terms of keeping fit,’’ he said. “We lined up some training programmes for them and we are doing some follow-ups and I am happy with their responses so far. “The guys are working with our experts to remain in shape and we have been impressed by their commitment.” Saruchera’s team is made up of both seasoned and inexperienced players. “We are a professional side and the players have a point to prove as some have not played in the Premiership while some were once in the top-flight league. “They need to remain focused and, for Covid-19, it is everyone’s duty to stay safe and we will wait until the right time comes.’’ The team boasts of players like Milton Kureva, Nesbert Padzarondora, Yussuf Wasili, Kelvin Chiripawako, Douglas Mbewe, Obey Gada, Martin Mine and Shadreck Jimu.
