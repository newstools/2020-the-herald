The Herald LIVERPOOL. — Liverpool have always been a side that needs “tough love”, says Gerard Houllier, with Jurgen Klopp proving to be the perfect coach to deliver “vision” and long-term success at Anfield. Those on the red half of Merseyside are currently basking in the warm glow of a first English Premiership football title triumph in 30 years. Since last getting their hands on the English top-flight crown in 1990, many managers have tried and failed to get Liverpool back on the loftiest of perches. Houllier spent six years at the helm between 1998 and 2004, delivering domestic cup success and a UEFA Cup win. He also carried the Reds close to a long-awaited title, as did Rafa Benitez and Brendan Rodgers. Klopp has been the man to get Liverpool over the line, while also claiming Champions League and Club World Cup honours, with the German considered to be a good fit for the most demanding of roles. Houllier told the Liverpool Echo: “Players need somebody who knows where he is going and what he wants to do. They follow somebody who has a vision. “And they need “tough love’’. You’ve got to be tough sometimes but you’ve got to love them. They need to understand that they can rely on you in case of a problem. “But you love them. Jurgen is a good demonstration of that as well.” — Goal.com
