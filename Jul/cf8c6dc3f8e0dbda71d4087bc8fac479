The Herald LONDON. — Try telling Jurgen Klopp and his players that Liverpool’s season is done. The English Premier League football title race may be over, but the newly-crowned champions still have plenty to play for. Dead rubbers? Not here. Not with this team and this manager. The Reds head to Arsenal tonight angry, and with something to prove. They have records in their sights, messages to send. And, perhaps, momentum to find as well. A 1-1 draw against Burnley ended Liverpool’s hopes of becoming the first-top flight side to win all of their home games in a league season since 1892. “It feels like we lost,” admitted Klopp in his post-match press conference. Arsenal, then, can expect a reaction. “It will be an interesting one,” Klopp said about the trip to the Emirates. Liverpool’s motivation will be strong. “Some people outside have said ‘is the desire there?’” said Robertson on Saturday. “But they obviously don’t know these lads or the manager very well. “When you put on this badge, when you put on this shirt, it carries a responsibility.’’ Liverpool know they need to win each of their three remaining games if they are to beat Manchester City’s all-time top-flight points record. — Goal.com
