GOVERNMENT is finalising amendments to the Mines and Minerals Act to align it with internationally competitive and supportive law, Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister Monica Mutsvangwa has said. The amendment of the Act will also see the inclusion of a policy that legalises the “use-it or lose-it” policy where mining title holders with underutilised or idle claims would be re-passed. Briefing journalist during a post-Cabinet meeting in Harare on Tuesday, Minister Mutsvangwa said: “The Ministry (Mines and Mining Development) is finalising amendments to the Mines and Minerals Act to bring the legislation in line with internationally competitive, modern, friendly and supportive law. “The amended Act will help enhance investor confidence.” She said the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development was also implementing the Mining Computerised Information Management (cadastre) System (MCIMS) to speed up registration of mining title and minimising disputes through correctly positioning mining titles. Last November, Government  set itself an “early 2021” deadline by which it should have migrated from the existing manual to the more efficient and computer-based cadastre system in the administration of mining title. A cadastre is normally a computer-based and up-to-date land information system containing a record of interests in land such as owners’ rights, restrictions and responsibilities. The mining title administration is key towards the achieving of a successful mining industry particularly the US$12 billion annual export industry by 2023.
