The Herald Music legend and philanthropist Buju Banton, through his eponymous foundation, recently gifted residents of Mount Olivet Boys’ Home with 100 pairs of an assortment of school shoes and football boots, as well as footballs. The facility in Manchester is home to 48 at-risk boys, ages six to 18. Facility representatives and some residents convened at Gargamel Music to accept the gifts, all of whom were excited to meet Buju Banton in person. In encouraging the youths, Buju told them, “You should always have hope. Never lose hope. We have to show those who abandoned us that we succeeded. “The child the parent abandoned will become the head cornerstone. Respect staff at the facility. As the world out there is cruel, Buju Banton Foundation is trying to be part of the programme of hope and change. Help each other, love each other. Above all, love God.” Foundation director Rosemary Duncan presented the items to facility director, Patrick Newman. “We are indeed impressed with the commitment shown by the Buju Banton Foundation to ensure the boys at Mount Olivet Boys’ Home are all prepared for the new school term. “This latest donation of 100 pairs of shoes could not have come at a more opportune time, and for that we are extremely grateful for your love and kindness. “In a time when many of our boys are marginalised and lacking parental guidance, the Buju Banton Foundation presents a beacon of hope for those who have come and will come through our gate,” said Duncan. The Buju Banton Foundation, established in January 2019, focuses on assisting at-risk males, ages 6-18, ensuring they are provided with the tool and opportunities to succeed. — Jamaican gleaner.
