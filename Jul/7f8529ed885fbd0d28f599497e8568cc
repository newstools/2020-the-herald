The Herald English Premiership Scenarios:
West Ham
l The Hammers secured their safety after holding Manchester United to a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford last night. They can now even afford to lose their final game on Sunday against Aston Villa. Aston Villa
l This is where it gets tricky. A win for Villa is probably enough, but if Watford were to match Villa’s result (win, loss or draw), it would come down to goal differential. For example, if both lose and Villa loses by less, the club would stay up as long as Bournemouth doesn’t win. Simply put, if Villa gets more points than Watford, they will be guaranteed to stay up. l If Villa lost 3-0 and Watford lost 1-0, with Bournemouth failing to win, then Watford would stay up on goal differential. l In the event that Villa and Watford finish with the same amount of points and goal differential, it would then go to goals scored where Villa has a big six-goal advantage. Watford
l Watford will stay up with a win or draw as long as Villa loses to West Ham. l Watford can lose and stay up if Bournemouth fails to win and Villa loses to West Ham by two more goals than Watford potentially loses to Arsenal by. l Watford will remain in the Premier League as long as it earns more points than Villa or if it matches Villa’s points and records a superior goal differential. If Watford were to lose 1-0 and Villa were to lose 3-0, Watford stays up. Bournemouth
l Bournemouth are in a really tough spot because the club has to win its last game at Everton to have any chance of staying up, but that will only be enough if both Watford and Villa loses and finish with a worst goal differential than the Cherries. So, in short, Bournemouth must win, see Villa and Watford both lose and have a better goal differential than both.
