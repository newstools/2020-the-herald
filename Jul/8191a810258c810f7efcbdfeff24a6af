The Herald South Africa is the most popular destination for travellers in a post-Covid-19 world, according to Tourlane, an online travel website. The survey solicited views of international tourists via Tourlane’s newsletter and social networks and counted the number of responses in the company’s four main languages: German, French, Dutch and English. It received some 600 answers, with SA, New Zealand and Canada topping the list of preferred destinations. Key reasons for wanting to visit South Africa are safari, visiting friends and relatives and scenery. However, affordability of flight tickets came in as the second-biggest barrier for international tourists to travel to South Africa, a separate survey by South African Tourism has revealed. International tourists who have visited South Africa in the past three years were surveyed by SA Tourism’s Strategy Insights and Analytics (SIA) team. Almost two-thirds of international travellers surveyed said they are ready to travel immediately after the lifting of international Covid-19 travel restrictions or within a year thereafter. Millennials (those aged 25-39) and tourists over 65 years old were the most likely have positive travel intentions. — news24.com.
