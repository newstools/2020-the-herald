The Herald NINETEEN-year-old Masimba Mutyiri believes he has come up with a technology that will improve security by adding lasers to phone cameras. The Harare-based computer programmer, says he has had other ideas for mobile phone applications. “I have always had an interest in this sort of work because I am a computer programmer. I have had a couple of ideas even for mobile phone applications. “I am at an institution called Sunshine Project Zimbabwe. My Technological idea is about a new design to mobile phone security.” These days, mobile phones come with facial recognition, finger print, iris scan and pattern, password or pin code features. Mutyiri’s idea is about transforming a mobile phone’s back camera into a new security system that uses lasers. “This is a big idea that can be used when a smartphone is left in a car. If there is a trespasser, the smartphone will automatically take pictures and send them back to a computer or set laptop. It also sends signals to the car and sounds the alarm,” explains the Westgate resident animatedly. “I also think that if we could add a facial recognition and iris scan so that when someone tries to trespass, the phone security system will automatically take a picture silently and sends them to another computer or phone.” The missing jigsaw puzzle to rolling out the technology, so far, is an investing partner.
