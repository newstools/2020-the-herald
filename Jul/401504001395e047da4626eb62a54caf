The Herald LONDON. — Virgil van Dijk held his hands up to an uncharacteristic error that cost Liverpool the chance to set a new English Premier League football record points tally as Arsenal came from behind to beat the champions 2-1. Just a third league defeat of the season for Jurgen Klopp’s men means the Reds cannot now match Manchester City’s record 100 points from two seasons ago. Sadio Mane put Liverpool in front as the visitors dominated for the first 30 minutes at the empty Emirates. But Van Dijk’s slack pass allowed Alexandre Lacazette to equalise before Alisson Becker also produced a rare mistake to allow Lacazette to tee up Reiss Nelson for the winner just before half-time. “The goals we give them as a present,” said Van Dijk. “If you give the goals away like we did today, including myself, you get what you deserve.” Liverpool have now dropped points in four of their seven games since the Premier League’s restart compared to just two prior to the shutdown. But Van Dijk said there was no shortage of motivation after clinching a first league title in 30 years. “It’s too easy to say that,” he added. “If you watch the game, until I made the mistake there was nothing wrong. I take the blame for it I take it as a man and we move on.” Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta’s mind appeared to be already focused on tomorrow’s FA Cup semi-final against his former side Manchester City as he left top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang on the bench among five changes from defeat in the north London derby to Spurs. But victory kept the Gunners’ chances of European football next season alive by moving up to ninth and within two points of seventh-placed Tottenham. — AFP.
