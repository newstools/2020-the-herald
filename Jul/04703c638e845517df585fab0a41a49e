ZIMBABWE cricket team batting coach, Stuart Matsikenyeri says the Chevrons are doing their best under the difficult Covid-19 lockdown conditions, to maintain good shape. They are preparing for the proposed resumption of their international calendar. The team embarked on a training camp last month following a lengthy lay-off. The Chevrons, who are still hoping to host Afghanistan in five T20Is, were given the greenlight to start training by Government. “Actually, we are quite happy to have been given the greenlight to train. I must say we have covered some ground since we started. “Obviously, we kicked off everything with strength and conditioning exercises. It’s unfortunate we could not get access to the gyms because they were closed as per the Covid-19 measures. “So, it was mainly about outdoor exercises designed by our fitness trainer, Walter Karimanzira. “Some fitness tests were conducted and the results came out quite decent. “It’s very encouraging that most of the guys passed, considering where we were coming from. “After the strength and conditioning, we then got into skills training and it’s working out well. Hopefully, from next week we will up the ante a bit more.” The players have been training in small zonal groups in Harare, Bulawayo, Mutare, Kadoma, Kwekwe and Masvingo. Matsikenyeri is one of the coaches overseeing progress in the absence of head coach, Lalchand Rajput, who is holed up in India. The players have been training in small groups at Harare Sports Club and Takashinga Cricket Club. Matsikenyeri is working alongside fitness trainer Karimanzira and bowling coach Douglas Hondo. The team’s immediate home series against Afghanistan is still waiting for approval from authorities. Zimbabwe and Afghanistan cricket boards have been in constant talks over the series. Afghanistan players tested negative for coronavirus this week following tests conducted by the Afghanistan Cricket Board.
