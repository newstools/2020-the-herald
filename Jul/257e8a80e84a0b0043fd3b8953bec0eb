The Herald MADRID. — Zinedine Zidane said Gareth Bale’s absence from Real Madrid’s squad for their draw with Leganes was a “technical decision”. Bale was left out of the squad as Madrid drew 2-2 with Leganes on Sunday, having already clinched the Spanish La Liga football title. The Wales international seems set to leave the La Liga giants after making just two appearances since the season resumed last month, with his behaviour while on the bench being questioned. James Rodriguez has been left out of the past five matchday squads — with personal reasons cited initially — and Zidane discussed the duo after finishing the La Liga campaign. “You know what happened with one (James). The other is a technical decision,” the Madrid coach said, via AS. Luka Jovic, meanwhile, came off the bench for what was just his second appearance since the coronavirus-enforced break. The forward has been linked with a move away after scoring just twice in 26 appearances in his first season in Madrid. — AFP.
