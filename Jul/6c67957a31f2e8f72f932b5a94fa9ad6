Unlike in the morning there is an increase in both human and vehicular traffic movement in Chitungwiza this afternoon. While the situation generally remains calm all over Chitungwiza with citizens going about their daily activities, there is a reported incident that happened at Unit C intersection, where some rogue youths set fire on some tyres at the intersection shortly before 5am. In St Maryâ€™s this afternoon, security forces dispersed crowded people that were milling around Chigovanyika Shopping Centre. After the dispersal, business is going on as usual. In Seke, people are also going about their business with shops including Ziyaduma open for business as usual.
