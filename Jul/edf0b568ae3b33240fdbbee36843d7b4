The Herald Runesu Gwidi Masvingo Correspondent A 52 year-old man from Chivi communal lands has been jailed for an effective 13 years for raping a mentally ill 38-year-old woman for five consecutive months until she fell pregnant. Chenjerai Mugadza recently appeared before Masvingo regional Magistrate Mrs Dambudzo Malunga on rape charges. Prosecutor Mr Liberty Hove told the court that Mugadza initially ambushed his victim at Mhosva Village while she was fetching firewood. He pinned her to the ground before raping her. He raped her again on several occasions between February and June 2019. Mr Hove said Ngomahuru Psychiatric Hospital examined the complainant and concluded that she is mentally retarded and unable to consent to issues of sex. The matter came to light when the complainant’s mother became suspicious and questioned her. She indicated that she had been raped and was now pregnant. The mother took her to Chidyamakono clinic where the pregnancy was confirmed. The matter was reported to the police in Chivi, leading to Mugadza’s arrest.
