The Herald Herald Reporter Parliamentâ€™s Committee on Standing Rules and Orders (CSRO) yesterday interviewed 23 people shortlisted to fill the four vacancies in the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission. The CSRO is mandated by the Constitution to conduct public interviews for the Commission. The four vacancies arose after the expiry of terms of four former commissioners; Dr Ellen Sithole, Mr Japhet Ndabeni-Ncube, Ms Kwanele Jirira and Dr Joseph Kurebwa. They were the pioneer members of the Commission and had served two terms as required by the Constitution. Professor Philani Moyo and Dr Admark Moyo, who are based in South Africa, were interviewed virtually. The other interviewees were Dr Ernest Dube, Ms Maretha Mazhale-Dube, Mr Cowen Dziva, Ms Michelle Gudo, Ms Jemina Gumbo, Dr Angeline Guvamombe, Mr Lloyd Kuveya, Mr Okay Machisa, Mr Paradzai Manyende and Mrs Beauty Kajese. The others are Ms Yvonne Masvora, Mr Simbarashe Maturure, Ms Abigail Mgugu, Dr Mandlenkosi Moyo, Mr Stanley Moyo, Mrs Dorothy Ngwenya-Moyo, Reverend Anouya Muchechetere, Dr Catherine Muchechetere, Mr Brian Penduka and Mr Abraham Mupuwi. Chaired by Speaker of the National Assembly, the CSRO quizzed the candidates on various issues including why they think they ought to be members of the Commission, the role of the Commission in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the reasons that led Government to establish the Commission, among others. The ZHRC is a national human rights institution established in terms of the Constitution. It is an independent Commission whose main mandate is to protect, promote and enforce human rights. The first Commissioners were sworn into office on March 31, 2010. The CSRO will make recommendations to the President when they complete the adjudication process for appointment.
