The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter LILY Blue is proving unstoppable ever since horse racing returned to Borrowdale Park three weeks ago. She won the Zimbabwe Oaks on Sunday. The Bridget Stidolph trained runner was outstanding in Sunday’s future race — the 2 000m Zimbabwe Oaks, which attracted a small field. Her stable companion Prescott finished second, ahead of Candy Cane and Centre Stage. Lily Blue had veteran jockey, Morgan Nyamagwete, as the pilot. “Just like a training gallop, it was an easy field but I now look forward to the next races,” said Nyamagwete. On Sunday Borrowdale Park hosted an eight-race card with the first race being the 1 100m Maiden Juvenile Plate in which eight horses took part. After a 114-day layoff, VainLikeThat returned to racing. Master Future started the race unsettled with VainLikeThat and Safiyaa leading by two lengths. At 600m Obscure and Seattle Swift were at the back while Magnus Maximus joined Safiyaa and VainLikeThat at the 400m mark. The final race was the 1 200m Pinnacle Plate (95) where Daffiq, with Norbert Takawira on the irons, triumphed. This was the Terzi’s yard’s fifth winner on Sunday.
