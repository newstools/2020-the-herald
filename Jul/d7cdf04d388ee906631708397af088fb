The Herald ROME. — Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri said his club ‘’lacked order’’ on Thursday but could still be crowned Serie A champions today. That will depend on the results of their rivals Atalanta and Inter Milan. The Turin giants missed a chance to seal the title after a shock 1-2 defeat ti Udinese on Thursday. “We paid for a lack of order after a good first half because we wanted to win at all costs,” said Sarri. “In this way we took the game to a dangerous level, and after the 90th minute, we lost it.” The coach added: “In this period we are physically and mentally tired.” Seko Fofana scored the winner as Juventus fell to ti struggling Udinese on Thursday night. Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt had put the defending champions ahead three minutes before the break in Udine. But, a diving Ilija Nestorovski header seven minutes after the interval got Udinese level, with Fofana completing a comeback for the north-eastern side in injury time. Juventus remain six points ahead of second-placed Atalanta with three games left to play, and have another chance to seal the title for the 36th time on the pitch at home against 14th-placed Sampdoria tomorrow. Udinese keeper Juan Musso denied Paulo Dybala — who was wearing the Juventus captain’s armband — after 13 minutes with Cristiano Ronaldo’s long-range effort wide before De Ligt broke through, smashing in after 42 minutes.
