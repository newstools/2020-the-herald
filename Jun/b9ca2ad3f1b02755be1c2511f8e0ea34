The Herald South Africa has received “firm commitment” running into billions of rands for some of the 276 infrastructure projects that the president’s investment envoys presented to investors around the globe in the past five months. President Cyril Ramaphosa was speaking at the inaugural Sustainable Infrastructure Development Symposium of SA. Like many other advanced and emerging countries around the world who are looking at infrastructure as a springboard to recover from the economic slump caused by the virus, the virus has made infrastructure investment more compelling and urgent for SA, said Ramaphosa.
