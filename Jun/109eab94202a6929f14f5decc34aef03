The Herald As Covid-19 continues to cause economic upheavals to many sectors of the global economy, in Zambia entities in the tourism and artefact businesses are now barely surviving while others have been forced to close their businesses. A visit to Kabwata Cultural Village, one of Zambia’s cultural heritage sites and a tourist place known for curios and a range of hand-crafted products situated in the nation’s capital Lusaka, revealed that business has been very slow if not non-existent. The place that is known to be a hive of activity almost throughout the year and particularly busy from April to September is now noticeably quiet and deserted with huts that serve as stands for merchandise abandoned. The traders at the site who are involved in the making and selling of a range of handicraft depicting Zambian and African culture and wildlife complained that the business worsened in the past three months. “The situation is dire. The majority of traders whose only source of income is either the making or selling of handicrafts are at the brink of destitution,” lamented Memory Mwenda, a trader. — Xinhua.
