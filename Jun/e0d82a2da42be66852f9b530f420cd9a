The Herald Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter SEASONED long-distance runner, Cuthbert Nyasango, has underscored the importance of planning and investment by athletes to cushion themselves in times of need. Although he the crisis brought by the Covid-19 pandemic will pass, the Olympian emphasised the importance for athletes to have a fallback plan for times like this. “I am positive that things will return to normal in the new normal,’’ he said. “As athletes, we just need to be innovative and start to be more pro-education. “This period has shown us the importance of planning, investment and education. “The problem with sport is we don’t know when we will stop, sometimes you get injured, so it’s always important to invest as early as you can. “We only know about today, we don’t know what tomorrow brings or holds for us.’’ Nyasango has indicated he is slowing down on his career, as an athlete, and is now channelling more of his energy into coaching at Bindura University of Science Education under the National Sports Academy. “The reason I am here is they want me to focus on the strength of this country, the middle and long distance runners,’’ he said. “That is the plan, we are trying to develop long distance runners, we have seen the potential at the Olympics, World Half marathon and World Championships.’’ Nyasango has had some impressive results, raising the country’s flag high, at the World Championships, Olympics and other international events. “We will see how things go because, right now, we can’t recruit because of the situation,’’ he said. “I think we have the potential. “What we need is to make sure we recruit a group of athletes who will be training and staying together, push each other, motivate each other under a coach who will monitor the training side, mental side, diet and everything. “At the moment, we have not resumed training, we are making sure all the requirements by Government are met.’’
