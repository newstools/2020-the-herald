The Herald LONDON. — Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang says he is at a turning point in his career and it will be a difficult decision whether to extend his contract at the London club or not. The Gabon international, whose deal ends in June 2021, has scored 61 goals in 97 appearances since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2018 but has yet to lift any major silverware in England. “I haven’t had an offer recently, but I did speak to the club quite a few months ago, and they know why nothing has happened yet,” Aubameyang, who turns 31 on Thursday, told French football programme Telefoot. “They have the keys. It is up to them to do their work and, after that, we will see how things go. It’s a turning point in my career and I want to be honest with everyone. It’ll certainly be a very difficult decision to make.” Aubameyang insists Arsenal know his demands and it is up to the club to get him to sign a new deal. The Gabon international is set to enter the final year of his contract and has been linked with Inter and Barcelona in recent months. Aubameyang’s wage demands are thought to be at the centre of discussions between the player and the club and the striker hinted was ready to leave the club if necessary. “I haven’t recently received a proposition but of course there have been discussions with the club,” he told French outlet Telefoot. “It’s them (the club) who have the keys and for them to do their work. Afterwards we will see what happens. “It is a turning point in my career. I have been very frank with everyone. It will be of course a very difficult decision to make. — (AFP.
