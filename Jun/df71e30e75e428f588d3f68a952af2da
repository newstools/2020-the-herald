The Herald WOLVERHAMPTON. — Another episode of the Adama Traore-Raul Jimenez show delivered Wolves a precious 1-0 win over struggling Bournemouth in the Premier League last night. In an almost carbon copy of Saturday’s opener in the win over West Ham United, Traore’s surging run and inch-perfect cross on the hour was met by Jimenez for his 15th league goal of the season. Ten of Mexican striker Jimenez’s goals have been assisted by Spanish winger Traore, making them the most lethal combination in the Premier League this season as Wolves continue to press for a Champions League qualification spot. Victory put them on 49 points in sixth place, the same total as fifth-placed Manchester United who have a better goal difference. Fifth place could possibly offer a Champions League berth this season, pending the outcome of second-placed Manchester City’s appeal against a UEFA ban. Bournemouth showed more grit than when losing to Crystal Palace in their first game back after the restart, although they created precious little at a sweltering Molineux, failing to manage an attempt on target. — Reuters.
