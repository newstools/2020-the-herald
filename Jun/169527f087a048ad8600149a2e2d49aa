THE Judicial Service Commission (JSC) yesterday celebrated its 10th anniversary and Open Day, allowing the public access to the courts to understand the functions of each court in terms of the law. The celebration ran under the theme; “Transparency and Accountability to enhance access to justice and the rule of law”. JSC deputy secretary legal service, Mrs Faith Mushure, spoke of the milestones achieved during the commission’s decade of existence and the importance of the day to the commission’s family and the nation at large. She said the day marked the complete separation of powers after the administration of the affairs of the Judiciary was weaned from the Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, thereby strengthening it’s independence. JSC head of communication and corporate affairs, Ms Rumbidzai Takawira, said the commission had realised the importance of making the public understand how the system operates, hence the introduction of open days.
