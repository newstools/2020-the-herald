The Herald MANCHESTER. — Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes Marcus Rashford is a potential future England captain and said it is an honour to manage the Manchester United striker, whose campaign over free meals for schoolchildren forced a government U-turn. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson reversed a decision not to give vouchers for use in the summer holidays, with the Prime Minister praising Rashford and his determination on the issue.  Rashford has also donated time and money to the FareShare charity, which has raised £20m to help feed vulnerable children. Solskjaer said: “It’s an honour to have Marcus and what he’s done during this lockdown. He’s been unbelievable — [to] help so many people that need it. He’s taken from his own experience when he was a kid. I know how much it means for the kids and we, as a club, are immensely proud of him. “He’s obviously a top footballer but also a fantastic human being — a future leader, a future captain, maybe, of England, Man United, who knows? He’s already captained the team [United]. We’re really proud of him and his family must be so proud as well of what he has achieved. As his manager as well it’s been fantastic to follow Marcus during the lockdown period; he got the prime minister to change his mind. Marcus is such a top human being — he’s changed the lives of so many kids this summer, which is more important than any game he’ll play.” United resume their season with tonight’s visit to Tottenham, the first of nine league games. Solskjaer said: “It’s big against one of the best teams in the league, Champions League finalists a year ago. — The Guardian.
