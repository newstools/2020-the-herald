The Herald Arts Reporter SOUTH Africa-based Zimbabwe-born musician, Innocent Gumbo, is making waves across the Limpopo River with his debut project titled “Vabereki Vakakosha”. Gumbo, also known as Inogumbo Chabile Dixon in music circles, released his project last week. Speaking from his SA base, Gumbo said he was already working on another album on which he has roped in the services of veteran guitarist Ronnie Mudhindo. “This project was a dedication to my parents who have seen me grown to this day. I owe my life to them, as they went through thick and thin to raise me. “It was not easy coming up with this project as we faced a lot of challenges, especially in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. This is a new type of sungura which I introduced where we use three guitars and keyboards,” he said. Gumbo expressed delight with the response his album was receiving and how people in SA were appreciating sungura music. “I was a bit sceptical about how people would receive our music in South Africa, but I am happy that they are appreciating our type of sungura. “There is overwhelming response from home (Zimbabwe ) and my music is being played on various radio stations. “To us it is a clear indication that we started on the right track. “As we speak, we are already working on a follow-up album where bassist Ronnie Mudhindo is assisting. We want to take advantage of the vast knowledge and experience that Mudhindo possesses to come up with a powerful album,” he said. The Cyclone Tjabile band leader said he was hoping to stage shows in the country, once the lockdown ends. Music promoter and Gumbo’s nephew Talkmore Charamba has committed to distribute and market the music locally. “Releasing a new project in the face of the current situation proves another level of commitment in music industry. “As music promoters we have to support such efforts. I commit myself to assist him in distributing and marketing his music locally,” he said.
