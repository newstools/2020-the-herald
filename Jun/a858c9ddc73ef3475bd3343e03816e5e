The Herald LOS ANGELES. — The wait for Tiger Woods’ PGA Tour return just got longer after he failed to commit to this week’s RBC Heritage by Friday’s deadline. Woods was not at Colonial Country Club last week for the Charles Schwab Challenge, the PGA Tour’s first event following a 91-day shutdown due to the coronavirus, and it has now been confirmed he won’t make the trip to Hilton Head, South Carolina, for next week’s tournament either. Next on the schedule is the Travelers Championship, an event Woods has never played in, while the following week’s Rocket Mortgage Championship in Detroit is a highly unlikely destination as that was the sponsor that left Woods’ tournament in Maryland, the Quicken Loans National, at the end of the 2018 season. The smart money now suggests Woods won’t be seen until July’s Memorial Tournament, which he has played whenever he has been healthy and has won five times. The 44-year-old Masters champion last competed on the PGA Tour in mid-February when he struggled to a final-round 77 at the Genesis Invitational. He was last seen in the charity match with Phil Mickelson and Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks Tom Brady and Peyton Manning on May 24. — AFP
