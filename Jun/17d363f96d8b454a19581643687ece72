The Herald MUMBAI. — Vasant Raiji, the world’s oldest first-class cricketer, died aged 100 in Mumbai on Saturday, his son-in-law Sudarsahan Nanavata told Indian media. Raiji, a right-handed batsman, played nine first-class matches between 1938 and 1950, scoring 277 runs at an average of 23.08. He was also a cricket historian. Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar and former Australia captain Steve Waugh visited Raiji at his Mumbai home on his 100th birthday on January 26. “His warmth and passion for playing and watching Cricket was endearing,” Tendulkar wrote of his meeting with Raiji on Twitter following the announcement of the death.
