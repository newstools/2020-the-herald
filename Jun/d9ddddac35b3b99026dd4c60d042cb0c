China-based Zimbabwean hip-hop artist Parker Kwinika (Jnr) affectionately known as “Yung Parka Baby” is stuck in Zimbabwe because of the coronavirus pandemic. Kwinika returned home in February to visit his family. That was before the coronavirus had affected countries globally. As a result, he has resorted to online lessons in order to keep abreast with others. “I have been giving myself time and space to learn how best to do it in the music industry. I have been taking online lessons, so I can catch up with others in China. I am studying Computer Science Engineering at Guilin University of Electronics and Technology. “I came to Zimbabwe in February and then got stuck because of the coronavirus.” The 21-year-old says he took up music because of the people around him and believes hip-hop needs full support of the industry. “I balance my music career and schooling as each has its own time and space. Music has been inside me. It’s really easy for me to make a new song without giving it full attention.” His father, Savious Parker Kwinika (Snr), a journalist, identified talent in the young boy and helped him to pursue it. Kwinika is taking the current lockdown as an opportunity to write songs. “I am preparing for my first album and want to engage the best producers. My new songs are inspired by my moods. My first E.P. is called ‘Baby’s World’,” he says. “To be honest I miss performing since it is my favourite thing when it comes to music. I learnt a lot from the Chinese community and, given a chance, I would want to share with everyone, what I have been learning so that it not only benefits me,” he says. Kwinika is well-known on social media. “I have done collaborations with different artists such as Yoz Wenyu, The Don Lamar, Flake Ice and Its Fucci among others. I also performed at the Changamire Hip-hop festival and Empire 263 and have also been nominated for several times at hip-hop awards,” he explains.
