The Herald The global tourism industry  suffered estimated losses of up to US$195 billion between January and  April this year due to the outbreak of the deadly Covid-19 worldwide,  the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) has said. Covid-19 first broke out in China’s Wuhan province last December, and  has since rapidly spread to virtually every part of the world, infecting  over eight million people and killing over 450 000 others. The UNWTO said the tourism sector was one of the hardest-hit by the  outbreak, impacting both travel supply and demand. “While April was expected to be one of the busiest times of the year  due to the Easter holidays, the near-universal introduction of travel  restrictions led to a fall of 97 percent in international tourist  arrivals. This follows a 55 percent decline in March,” it said. — New Ziana.
