ZIFA Eastern Region Soccer League Division One chairman, Davison Muchena, says they have no option but follow the European leagues calendar for the 2020 season. The administrator said they will follow the proposals by the national leadership for the championship to start in August or September. “Our aim is to have the season starting by August, it will be difficult, but we will try our best,’’ he said. “We had moved on well, in terms of registering our players and clubs for the forthcoming season, and everything was in place for the start of the season. “We are hopeful we will manage to follow the European league programmes for the mean time. “We know we will have some challenges, during the rain season, as our drainage systems are a course of concern. “There are several factors to consider but we will have to try our best as the game should be played.” Muchena has promised to rebrand the league and help bring in sponsors. “I don’t think we will have any challenges as we have already registered our clubs and players with ZIFA Connect so that no players will switch alliance during the lockdown period,’’ he said “Most of our clubs are preparing for the season although we are not yet sure as to when it will resume but, at the moment, we are being guided by faith. “Many clubs had managed to pay their affiliation fees while others had payment plans put in place,’’ said Muchena.
