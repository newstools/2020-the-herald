The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter THE Harare Province Division Two league will today host a consultative meeting with all their club representatives at Raylton Sports Club where constitutional amendment will be the main agenda. The league will discuss several issues related to the amendment of their constitution. They will also discuss the way forward as football is still under lockdown. League chairman, Robert Tembo, said they were inviting all club representatives to attend the meeting. “We are looking forward to hold a small consultative meeting whereby we will take a look into our constitution, which many feel needs to be amended in some areas,’’ said                                                                         Tembo. “We will also discuss the way forward, in as far as the league is concerned. “We are aware of the current lockdown rules, which we will adhere to. “We had some plans before the pandemic but we need to brief each other on how we can survive in these trying times. “The league needs us to guide them as there is little hope that we may resume in September.’’ Tembo hailed some clubs, who have fully affiliated with them, saying this will help to keep the league afloat. “We rely on the clubs in running the league and it is in the best of their interests to be part of the meeting,’’ said Tembo. “There are some clubs which have managed to remain up-to-date with their affiliation fees, which shows a lot of commitment on the part of the clubs.’’
