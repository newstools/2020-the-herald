The Herald Tadious Manyepo Sports Reporter CHAMPION boxer, Charles Manyuchi, continues to lead by example after he donated goodies, worth thousands of dollars, to the needy members of the society in Damofalls yesterday. Manyuchi donated grocery hampers worth over $70 000 to the vulnerable members, including the elderly, the disabled, orphans and widows, in Damofalls and Zimre Park. He was partnered by a leader of a Masowe eChishanu in Damofalls, Wydenge Kashiri. “This is my small token of saying thank you to the people of Zimbabwe,” said Manyuchi. “This is an ongoing programme. I have started with this community after Kashiri approached me but I am going to move around the country doing the same. “I know how it is going to bed on an empty stomach. “Vulnerable members need our assistance. I have harvested something at my rented plot in Chivhu and I have decided to share rather than sell the produce. “Covid-19 is real and it has crippled the survival means of many families and, so, I have just decided to chip in my small way. “I will go to Wedza, Chivhu and other areas after I am done with the Harare suburbs. “Let’s all unite against the spread of this pandemic.” Manyuchi was supposed to have gone into the ring on April 4 at the Harare International Conference for the World Boxing Federation title defence against Ugandan Muhhamed Sebyala. But the coronavirus pandemic forced the postponement of that fight.
