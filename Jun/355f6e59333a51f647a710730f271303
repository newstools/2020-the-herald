The Herald Another 1,9 million Americans have filed unemployment claims, bringing the total to over 42 million, according to the latest figures from the US department of labour. In the comparable week in 2019, initial claims stood at 189 577.  Unemployment claims have been on the rise for nine straight weeks, bringing the insured unemployment rate up to 14,8 percent for the week ending May 23, an increase of 0,5 percentage point from the previous week.  And though the number of new weekly claims has decreased from previous record-breaking levels, the four-week moving average stands at 2 284 000. Before the pandemic, the US unemployment rate stood at 3,5 percent, a 50-year low. It is now higher than it has been at any time since the 1930s’ Great Depression. Job losses peaked at 6,6 million at the beginning of April, and some economists have predicted that May’s upcoming monthly jobs report will see unemployment figures rising close to 20 percent. — fin24.com
