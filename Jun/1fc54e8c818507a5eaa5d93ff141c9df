The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter FORMER Premiership side,Mushowani Stars,have joined forces with Trojan Stars to mount a strong challenge in the ZIFA Northern Region Soccer League. The new side have already registered with the league. Takunda Mutandiri, the team manager, said they were ready for the 2020 season. “The club is still in existence and we are now running,’’ he said. “The team will be in partnership with Trojan Mine and we hope to assemble a very competitive side that will compete for honours once again. “The partnership has seen us registering two stadiums, for the forthcoming season, which are Trojan and Chaminuka in Madziva.’’ Former club owner, Lovemore Nyakasoka, decided to step aside but left the franchise in the hands of his relatives and children. The farmer said he had realised his dream of taking his club into the Premiership. “After the old man (Nyakasoka) called it a day, we saw it fit to engage some partners,’’ said Mutandiri. “And, it looks like it is bearing fruits as we have another benefactor who will help us during the season.’’ The merging of the two clubs will provide the community with a potentially explosive Mashonaland Central derby against ambitious club, Simba Bhora, of Shamva, who are also in the same league. Simba Bhora are owned by businessman, Simba “Buju’’ Ndoro. They have already been involved in an ambitious project to renovate Wadzanai Stadium in Shamva.
