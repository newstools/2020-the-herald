The Herald ASUNCION. — Ronaldinho admitted it has been “60 long days” as he remains on house arrest ahead of his trial. The Brazilian football star spent 32 days behind bars after he was arrested for allegedly trying to enter Paraguay with a fake passport. Ronaldinho is now staying at the four-star Hotel Palmaroga in the Paraguayan capital Asuncion. During an interview with Mundo Deportivo, the 40-year-old lifted the lid on his life while under house arrest. He said: “Here at the Palmaroga Hotel we have excellent treatment. “We have everything well ordered, we are very calm and they do anything to pass time in the most pleasant way possible. “It has been sixty long days. “People in their homes must imagine what it must be like not being to do what you are used to. “I think that is something will remain forever to all us after living this complicated experience.” During his stint in jail, Ronaldinho lost a doubles game of footvolley to a convicted murder and a robber. He scored five goals and made six assists after being convinced to play in the prison futsal tournament. And the 2002 World Cup winner admitted he can still have a kick about while on house arrest in Paraguay. Ronaldinho said: “We do sports and academy almost every day. “We have a gym where we can work and a room that has been adapted for us.” The hotel that the 40-year-old is staying in is owned by the Barcelona group — and he remains very grateful to his former club. He said: “Definitely Barcelona and I are united forever. It will always be my second city. “It is the most incredible club and the fans live deep in my heart.” When asked what he would say to everyone who has been watching over him, Ronaldinho said: “I thank you with all of my heart.” — The Sun.
