The Herald Court Correspondent THE trial of suspended PetroZim Line (Pvt) Ltd general manager Catherine Katsande, accused of awarding a US$2 million tender for equipment delivered six years late, continued last week, with the court dismissing her application for discharge. Katsande is facing seven counts of fraud and is jointly charged with Kaltrade (Pvt) Ltd, the winner of the contract. In her defence, Katsande told the court that she could not be called a fraudster since everything she did was in line with her duties and she was allowed to do so. She denied all the allegations being levelled against her. Harare magistrate Mr Lazini Ncube recently dismissed her application for discharge at the close of the State’s case. He said it had to be explained why Kaltrade failed to supply goods since 2013, only to supply them last year, after the matter had been reported to the authorities. “There is no reason or explanation given as to why Kaltrade delayed delivering the goods,” said Mr Ncube. “Therefore, the accused must be put to their defence.” Mr Ncube said the State managed to prove a prima facie case against Katsande and Kaltrade. Prosecutors Mr Tafara Chirambira and Mr Panganayi Chiutsi told the court that on seven separate occasions between January 2013 and September last year, Katsande fraudulently and in connivance with a private company, awarded it various tenders for equipment that was immediately paid for, but never delivered.
