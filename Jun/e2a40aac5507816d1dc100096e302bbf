The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Former Mamelodi Sundowns defender Lovers Mohlala has weighed in on the debate about whether former Kaizer Chiefs striker Knowledge Musona should return to the Soweto giants or join Mamelodi Sundowns if he is coming back to Mzansi in his next move. A move back to Mzansi’s topflight is one of the options for the Zimbabwean in his next move, although he is believed to be also attracting interest from overseas. “I don’t want to say whether Knowledge Musona will be good to go to Sundowns or Kaizer Chiefs, I don’t want to market Knowledge Musona. But if Knowledge is good enough, he can go anywhere,” Mohlala told the Siya crew. “But if you look back, South Africa used to be a retirement centre. Years ago, people (player) had to come and retire here in South Africa, because they have had enough or they couldn’t play anywhere,” he said. Musona has two more years to run on his contract with Anderlecht in Belgium and is an important player for the Warriors as their captain. — Soccer Laduma.
