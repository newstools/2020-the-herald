The Herald Herald Reporter Former Herald reporter Cornelius Nduna (49) collapsed and died at his house in Gletwyn, Harare, yesterday morning in what has been described as a case of sudden death. The journalist collapsed while working on his laptop computer and was rushed to St Joseph Clinic in Shawasha Hills, where he was pronounced dead. Family spokesperson and Harare City Council director of health services, Dr Prosper Chonzi, confirmed Nduna’s death, saying he had no previously known health complications. “It was what may be called a sudden death. We are deeply shocked because he was working normally at the family home he had just finished building with his wife when he collapsed. His body has been taken to Nyaradzo Funeral Parlour and we are awaiting the post mortem results,” said Dr Chonzi. Born on November 19, 1970, Nduna worked for various local newspapers, including The Herald and The Standard, where he distinguished himself as an investigative reporter. He later worked in South Africa as a media trainer and for international news organisations such as Associated Press and Sky News, mainly as a freelance journalist. Nduna is survived by his wife and fellow journalist Vongai Makamure. The couple had two children. Zimbabwe Union of Journalists (ZUJ) secretary-general Foster Dongozi described Nduna’s death as a very sad day for Zimbabwean journalism and a great loss to the industry. “We have lost a pillar. Journalism is poorer following the loss of our comrade. He was a gentleman and a professional journalist who moved seamlessly through the public and private media and became an international correspondent. “Rest in peace the Bull Eland,” said Dongozi. Dr Chonzi said burial arrangements will be announced in due course.
