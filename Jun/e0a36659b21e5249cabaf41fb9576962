The Herald Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Arts Reporter The current lockdown to combat coronavirus has led to a halt in entertainment activities and club DJs are now feeling the pinch. While they have been away from restaurants and bars where there are resident selectors, most have started creating own platforms where they roll out music. In an interview with The Herald Arts, some disc jockeys said things are hard but they have to dance according to the current tune. “This Covid-19 pandemic has greatly affected us. We were used to selecting music in bars and restaurants as well as parties and weddings but since all those events have been suspended, we have joined the bandwagon of entertaining on social media. I managed to get a slot with Zimpapers Television Network (ZTN) in conjuction with Prophet Passion Java to do sessions at Gara Mumba Iwe live shows as headline act,” said Abisha Palmer. The Mbare-bred disc jockey said the lockdown has given them time to research and learn about music. “I am a reggae and dancehall fan and this is a great opportunity to research on what I would love the people to know about the genre. Because of the exposure we got from hosting the Gara Mumba show I have managed to interact with fans closely and get their feedback about our shows.” For Adrain Mabika, affectionately known as DJ StarBoy, who usually plays at Pabloz Restaurant, this era has brought a new page. “I have set up my decks at home in the Avenues area and I host my Friday shows on my Instagram pages. I have been keeping people entertained and the advantage is that you play what they request compared to other times where you create your playlist and they dance according to tune,” he said. Another wheel spinner Tapuwa Mhlanga, known as T-Fresh said he has suspended turntable activity for the moment. “I had planned to make a comeback in April but with this pandemic it is not possible. I will wait until August and assess the situation in order to have a new strategy,” he said.
