The Herald Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter BANKET United’s new coach, Selestino Chikaka, believes they will have the quality to do well when the ZIFA Northern Region Division One League gets underway. Chikaka has replaced his former boss, Austin Mashanda. Banket United fought relegation, for the better part of last season, but Chikaka is hopeful they will be competitive if this season starts. “We are under lockdown but we are trying by all means to make sure our players remain active, in terms of their fitness levels,’’ he said. “We are giving the players some guidelines to follow and they are exercising a lot. “This year, we hope to finish in a respectable position rather than fight relegation like we did last season. “It’s unfortunate that we were forced to have this long break but I just hope the players stick to their training programmes.’’ Banket United had a very good home record last season, not losing at their fortress at Kuwadzana Stadium, which helped them avoid relegation. “I think we have a very strong and experienced side, we have retained most of our seasoned players,’’ said Chikaka. “The team remains intact as we have managed to tie down players like captain Arkson Labana, Kenny Mageja, Kiswell Mandovha and Jairos Kasonda.’’ The team have also recruited former Mbare National captain, Emmanuel Gomera.
