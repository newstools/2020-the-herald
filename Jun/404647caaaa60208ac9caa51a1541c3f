The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — Former South African president FW de Klerk’s spokesperson says he “withdrew his acceptance” of an American Bar Association (ABA) invitation to speak on, among other things, rule of law, racism and “minority rights” because he did not want to cause embarrassment to event organisers — who stated on Saturday that they had cancelled the event. But Dave Steward, on behalf of De Klerk, says the allegation that he was involved in gross violations of human rights is “baseless”. “Despite its diligent investigation of all of the evidence before it, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission failed in its efforts to link him with any such action. However, it appears unacceptable in the current super-heated racial climate that any leader from South Africa’s troubled past should be permitted to retain the slightest vestige of honour.” De Klerk was scheduled to speak to Jonathan Granoff, the president of the Global Security Institute, in a virtual discussion on “Lessons Learned in the Crucible of Courage and Conscience” hosted by the ABA on July 1. “We understand that Mr Granoff issued the invitation because of the role that FW de Klerk played in initiating and co-directing South Africa’s historic transition from white minority rule to non-racial constitutional democracy; because he is the only national leader who has ever dismantled an existing nuclear arsenal; and for his continuing defence of South Africa’s embattled constitution,” Steward says. But, following a deluge of objections from, among other people, former Truth and Reconciliation commissioners, global and local human rights lawyers, activists and legal bodies and the son of murdered anti-apartheid activist Fort Calata, the ABA International Law Section confirmed to News24 that De Klerk’s conversation had been cancelled. — News24.
