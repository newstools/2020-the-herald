The Herald Herald Reporter Informal traders at the Africa Unity Square flower market yesterday fumigated the facility in preparation for their return after a three-month absence due to the national lockdown. Africa Unity Square Market chairperson Mr Tapiwa Mhiko said they were looking forward to return to work as soon as the local authority gave them the green light. “Since the first lockdown announcement we have been at home,” he said. “It has been almost three months without work. When President Mnangagwa gave his latest Covid-19 update in which he was talking about opening up the economy further and gave leeway for the informal sector to return if they register, we did not waste time and started mobilising for our return.” The fumigation process is part of the requirements stipulated by City of Harare for all businesses. “When we heard that we can return to work, we engaged city council who told us to clean and sterilise our place before they come for inspection,” said Mr Mhiko.
