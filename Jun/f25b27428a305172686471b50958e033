The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — South Africa’s director of rugby Rassie Erasmus faced a potentially life-threatening health scare in 2019 that required chemotherapy before and during the Rugby World Cup in Japan. According to a Rapport article yesterday, Erasmus was diagnosed with microscopic polyangiitis with granulomatosis — a rare autoimmune disease — in early 2019. The disease is not cancerous but it can severely impact the lungs, kidneys, sinuses and trachea and Erasmus is understood to have suffered a rare strain of the disease that, according to his doctor Johan Theron, was potentially fatal. According to the report, Erasmus continued with the treatment until March 2020 and it was considered successful. “Rassie was treated for a serious condition in 2019, from which he has recovered,” a SA Rugby spokesperson confirmed to Sport24 yesterday. “He thanks people for their concern but wishes to keep the matter private.”— Sport24.
