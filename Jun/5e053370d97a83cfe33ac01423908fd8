While it may be a little different this year due to coronavirus and lockdown regulations, the day will see families around the world celebrating and presenting their fathers or male guardians with gifts to appreciate their love. It is either you are with your father at home or he is in a different location in or outside the country. Having to stay home does not have to be a bad thing as this is a time when we can be closer as family and get more united. Despite the situation around us, we should take the opportunity to celebrate our fathers and make them happy. You may not be able to go and eat out as a family, take your father out for golf or fishing, but you can do braai or barbecue at home. You can celebrate in various ways! Saturday Herald Lifestyle caught up with different people who said the day is just a formality but fathers should be celebrated every day. They shared their various plans and ideas on how they will spend the day. “Father’s day for me is as special as Mother’s Day. My father is retired and currently in the rural areas of Zaka working on his farming projects. “I am getting him a very nice customised winter jacket. After the lockdown we will continue our tradition of having a braai as a family at home,” said Takemore Mazuruse of Harare. <img class="wp-image-492255 size-full" src="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/1906-1-1-LLLL.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="380" srcset="https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/1906-1-1-LLLL.jpg 680w, https://www.herald.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/1906-1-1-LLLL-360x200.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /> The Mandere family in the UK Mazuruse said this is the time to be creative since it is now difficult to roam around looking for gifts, so people should celebrate within their means. “Though we have to stay home, that does not mean we cannot keep making plans with some of our favourite people. We are lucky to live in a digital and hyper-connected age. We should make the most out of it. You can surprise your father by organising a group video call with everyone in the family, no matter how far away they are during this lockdown. You can do this, thanks to applications such as Houseparty, Zoom, WhatsApp among others. Group video calling applications have become Apps of the moment,” he said. United Kingdom-based Zimbabwe philanthropist, Rudo Mandere, said she was planning something for her husband. “We never miss Father’s Day with my family. Our children are very young and they sometimes save money to buy presents but with the lockdown it is difficult. “However, we are doing a DIY (do it yourself) gift. I am yet to find out what Tanaka and Asher have planned for their dad, but I have ordered a cake. “We are going to have breakfast and here in UK people are cooking different African dishes. I am going to order something for my husband. “He is going to receive handmade presents from the kids. For my philanthropic work, I have dedicated the day to my late father and I have started a project where I will be handing out groceries to the less privileged affected by Covid-19, in memory of my father. I am also planning to open a foundation back home for feeding the poor especially children in communities like Epworth, Kambuzuma, Mbare and Mabvuku,” she said. Mandere shared her expertise in DIY products which can be helpful tomorrow. “From a frame with pictures to an improvised keychain with initials using a scrabble tile, or try a personalised T-shirt, a mug that is already lying around the house, you can still make the ‘superman’ happy,” she said. Many online portals are offering cakes and gifts that will be delivered at doorsteps during the lockdown under strict prescribed protocols. “Choose a delectable cake for him and pair it with a bunch of flowers or gifts and send them to his doorstep. Make him smile and fill him with delight even when you are far away from him. “The celebrations surely demand a delectable cake. You can either bake a special Father’s Day cake or order one online,” said Fatima Makungunyana of Glen Norah. Businessman-cum-pastor Misheck Timburwa affectionately known as Shacky said he was not expecting much away from his favourite breakfast or lunch. “I think this year was my best Father’s Day because my wife bore me a very beautiful daughter. Nothing more I want from them except a heavy breakfast or lunch. I know they have been planning a lot over the past years, but because of the Covid-19 the situation is different now. I have three children and I know they will be battling it out to draw a picture of me. I cherish that and I always put their drawings each year on my desk,” he said. Recently-engaged popular actor Zolile Makeleni known as Tsotsi said he was planning a surprise treat for his father. “I am going to visit my father and present my gift. I have a surprise for him which he has been longing for years and this is the time. I cannot share much details,” he said. Another gift expert, Shyleen Chimedza, suggested it was is fun to go down memory lane and play some old school games if one is locked down with his or her father. “Surely your father has some stories to tell you and there are photo albums in the house. “Get his childhood photo album and ask about his memories from childhood days. Once you are done with the photo albums, get old frames and start designing,” she said.
