The Herald The outbreak of Covid-19 has hit  the Marondera Municipality hard financially, reducing its daily average  revenue collections from $110 000 to just $10 000 now, a top official of  the council has said. Marondera mayor, councillor Chengetai Murova confirmed the sharp downturn in the council’s financial fortunes in an interface meeting  with the media and representatives of informal traders. The meeting was called to compare notes on how the lockdown had  affected various sectors in the town, particularly informal traders. The mayor said the council had also been terribly affected revenue wise  by the lockdown, with inflows now just a trickle of pre-Covid-19 levels. “As council, we have not been spared by this enforced national lockdown  due to the coronavirus pandemic. Before the lockdown, we were not  financially stable, but at least we would manage to collect reasonable  amounts on a daily basis from the residents and other ratepayers. “We would collect, on average, ZWL$110 000 on a daily basis, but our  daily collections have since gone down to ZWL$10 000 per day. —  New Ziana.
