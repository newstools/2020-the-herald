The Herald LONDON. — Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City and other Premier League clubs are not ready for games every few days because players have been “on the sofa” for most of the three-month layoff caused by coronavirus. City return to action with today’s visit of Arsenal and have, at least, 12 matches left as they are still in the Champions League and FA Cup. The schedule becomes hectic from next week, when they play at home to Burnley on Monday, at Chelsea on Thursday and in the Cup on Sunday at Newcastle. “We are not ready. Not just Man City, all the teams. But that’s why we have to rotate and use all the players. You can play a game after three weeks of holidays but we were two (months) of holidays lying on the sofa, doing nothing much, and that’s why the players are not fully fit. “But we have to start and we have to finish the season because the damage economically to all clubs must be as little as possible.” — The Guardian.
