The Herald NEW YORK. — Serena Williams committed to play at this year’s US Open on Wednesday as US Tennis Association officials vowed they can safely stage the first Grand Slam since the coronavirus pandemic shutdown. With top men’s stars questioning the wisdom of the staging the event, the USTA said the tournament will be held 31 August to 13 September without spectators at New York’s National Tennis Centre, which in April became a temporary hospital facility to combat the coronavirus pandemic. “I really can’t wait to return to the US Open 2020,” Williams said in a video message. “I think the USTA is going to do a really good job of ensuring everyone is going to be safe. “This is crazy. I’m excited.” The Flushing Meadows fortnight will be the first Grand Slam event staged since the deadly virus outbreak shut down global sport. Wimbledon was cancelled and the French Open was postponed until September. The site will also host the ATP/WTA Western and Southern Open, typically staged in Cincinnati, the week before the US Open with a similar safety “bubble” that includes testing for players and their entourage. The USTA expects an 80% drop in net operating income as a result of having no spectators for the US Open but will provide US$60 million in prize money for the two events in New York combined plus another US$3.3 million each to the ATP and WTA. “I’m confident a lot of athletes want to return to play,” said US Open tournament director Stacey Allaster. . — AFP.
