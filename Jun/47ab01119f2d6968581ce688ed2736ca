The Herald Gold prices rose yesterday, as fears that new coronavirus cases could impede economic recovery bolstered demand for the precious metal and weighed on riskier assets. Spot gold was up 0.3 percent at $1 731,88 per ounce by 9:33am, having earlier hit a near one-week high of $1 736,49. US gold futures rose 0.5 percent to $1 744,80 per ounce. Gold, seen as a safe asset during times of economic turmoil, continues to be supported by persistent concerns over the state of the global economy, said FXTM market analyst Han Tan. “Investors are currently dealing with competing narratives, between the risks of a second wave and the optimism surrounding the post-pandemic recovery,” Tan said. Once markets get more clarity that should determine bullion’s path outside of the $1 660-$1 750 range, he said. The imposition of travel curbs in Beijing to stop a new outbreak of coronavirus in the Chinese capital and surging new infections in several US states have marred hopes of a swift global economic recovery, pressuring stock markets. Investors now await a Bank of England meeting, where policymakers are expected to expand quantitative easing, and US weekly jobless claims data, due later yesterday, for further clues on the global economic outlook. — Reuters.
