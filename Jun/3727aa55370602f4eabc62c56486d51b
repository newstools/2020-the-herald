The Herald LONDON. — Britain’s world heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua has defended the wording of a speech he gave at a Black Lives Matter march at the weekend. Joshua took to social media to suggest that footage of his speech had been edited out of context. The first line of his tweet ended in an expletive: “If you think I’m a racist. “If you watch the whole video, the speech was passed around for someone to read and I took the lead. “I personally spoke from the heart about the Watford community, ideas of us personally investing seven figures to create unity and opportunities and adding change to the African/Caribbean community. “Shops aren’t the issue here. “Before you talk (negatively) you better boycott racism. “I said what I said and I will act to make change.” The IBF, WBA and WBO heavyweight champion marched in his hometown on Saturday. He wore a knee brace and had a crutch supporting an injury but has insisted that it won’t affect him long-term. Joshua said during his speech at the Black Lives Matter protest: “We can no longer sit back and remain silent on these senseless, unlawful killings and sly racism on another human being — based on what? Only their skin colour. — Sky Sports.
