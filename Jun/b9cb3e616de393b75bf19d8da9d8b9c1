The Herald JOHANNESBURG. — As of Tuesday, the number of pupils across Gauteng who have contracted Covid-19 is 58, while 188 educators have contracted the virus. The majority of schools in the province have reopened, but some could not because of infrastructural challenges. Others had to close due to positive cases and community disruptions linked to contracts for PPE and infrastructure, including communities resisting deployment of brigades from other communities. This was announced during the weekly statistics release by premier David Makhura on behalf of the Gauteng Covid-19 command council yesterday. “Confirmed cases from Wednesday sits at 26 126, with 6 627 recoveries and 147 deaths,” he said. “A total of 1 045 people are hospitalised in the public and private facilities — 67 of whom are ventilated, 248 on oxygen. “Our clinicians emphasise that early interventions are important (oxygenation, fluid supportive treatment, prone position & blood thinning) could be the reason behind fewer complications and low mortality.” Out of a total of 24 905 contacts traced, 16 527 people have completed the 14-day monitoring period with no symptoms reported and therefore they are de-isolated. Johannesburg is the provincial epicentre with 12 892 confirmed cases, followed by Ekurhuleni on 5 377 and 4 059 in the Tshwane district. — Times Live.
