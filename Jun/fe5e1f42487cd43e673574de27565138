I am glad to have worked with the likes of Baba Manyeruke, Agatha and Ruth. They showed me how to do it in the gospel arena and I am following their footsteps. This album (Njere Zhinji) has surpassed my expectations and such reception inspires me to continue releasing music with a purpose of bringing people to God.”
