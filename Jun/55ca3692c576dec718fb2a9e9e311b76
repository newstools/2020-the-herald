The Herald Apple on Monday previewed its latest version of desktop operating system, macOS Big Sur with new features and designs during its virtual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). “macOS Big Sur is a major update that advances the legendary combination of the power of UNIX with the ease of use of the Mac, and delivers our biggest update to design in more than a decade,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of Software Engineering. The new features include a customisable start page, tabs, translation, and newly-added privacy report. The updated messages app lets Mac users send and receive more personal and expressive messages, and easily keep track of and interact with within-group messages. Maps also offers a new experience with immersive exploring and navigating features, the company said. – xinhuanet.com.
