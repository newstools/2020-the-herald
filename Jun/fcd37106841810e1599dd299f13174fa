The Herald Thupeyo Muleya Beitbridge Bureau Police have arrested a suspected border jumper who tried to disarm a female soldier who was on patrol at Beitbridge border post last Thursday afternoon. Nhlanhla Mpala is alleged to have attacked the soldier on the exports commercial side after failing to secure transport to South Africa. Matabeleland South police spokesperson Chief Inspector Philisani Ndebele could not be reached for comment yesterday. Security sources said the man was now in police custody and was facing robbery charges. “Initial investigations are that Mpala tried to secure transport on commercial trucks heading to South Africa, but failed,” said a source who preferred anonymity. “He then attacked a female soldier and attempted to disarm her, but was overpowered by another soldier. During the tussle, one shot was fired from the gun. The motive behind his actions are yet unknown.” The official said the man was questioned by members of the Zimbabwe National Army, who then handed him over to the police for further investigations. In 2016, another Zimbabwe National Army soldier stationed at Beitbridge border post was beaten and disarmed by a rival suitor in a bushy area near Dulivhadzimu Clinic on Boxing Day. The army private who was on duty decided to go and see his girlfriend at a bus terminus in the suburb. The two then went to the bush behind the clinic. Clifford Muchera, who was also in love with the same woman, was spying on them. Muchera confronted the two, resulting in a scuffle with the soldier. Muchera got the better of his rival and disarmed him before disappearing into the bush with his AK-47 service rifle, leaving behind a magazine with 30 lives rounds. Muchera allegedly gave the firearm to a friend Moffat Makuyana, who is still at large.
