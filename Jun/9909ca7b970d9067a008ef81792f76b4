President Mnangagwa will today launch the Zupco Urban Buses initiative at Chinhoyi University of Technology grounds. The launch, which seeks to address transport challenges particularly in the town, follows the successful roll out of similar programmes in other urban centres. The revival of Zupco has also seen a number of private player franchising with commuter omnibuses having joined the bandwagon across the nation. Confirming the launch, Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Mashonaland West, Mary Mliswa-Chikoka told The Herald on the sidelines of the preparatory meeting, which was attended by all provincial heads of Government departments at CUT grounds that the launch would accord the province an opportunity to interact with the President and air transport challenges being faced by the province. “The President will launch Zupco urban buses here in Chinhoyi on Friday (today), which is line with new dispensation’s plans to provide its citizens with affordable and cheap modes of transport,” she said. She said the province had a number of districts and wards that were being serviced by unscrupulous private transporters and the initiative by the President would go a long way in providing affordable and decent transport. Due to the Covid-19 restrictions, she said, the number attendees was expected to be restricted to the stipulated guidelines.
