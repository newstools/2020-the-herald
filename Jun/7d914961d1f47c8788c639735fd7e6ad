The Herald LONDON. — Liverpool’s 30-year wait to win the English Premiership football title could come to an end this week, but the Reds must rely on Manchester City dropping points at Chelsea. Jurgen Klopp’s men host Crystal Palace in the first Premier League game at Anfield for 110 days today. A 0-0 draw at Everton in their first match for three months on Sunday means the champagne will remain on ice even if Liverpool return to winning ways. However, victory for Klopp’s side will leave City needing to win at Stamford Bridge 24 hours later to deny Liverpool the title. Palace were the last team visiting team to win a league match at Anfield over three years ago. The Eagles impressed in their comeback with a 2-0 win at Bournemouth on Saturday to close to within four points of the European places and Klopp was impressed with what he saw. “I saw Crystal Palace and they look like a proper-oiled machine,” said the German. “They have four times in a row now a clean sheet, so it will be a tough job 100 per cent, I know that. But that is how the Premier League is always, so no problem with that.” Liverpool are hopeful of having Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson back fit after both were badly missed in the Merseyside derby. City’s strength in depth was on show as Pep Guardiola was able to make eight changes for Monday’s 5-0 thrashing of Burnley. Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling are among those expected to come back into the side for the stiffer test of Chelsea, who will be looking to cement their place in the top four. Frank Lampard’s men came from behind to beat Aston Villa 2-1 on Sunday to open up a five-point lead over Manchester United and Wolves. “Now we have three points when some teams have lost points around us,” said Lampard. “We played well in patches but when they put us under pressure slightly, I thought we gave it away too easily – things we will definitely have to clean up on in the future games coming up.” —  AFP.
