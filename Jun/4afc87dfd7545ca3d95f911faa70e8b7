The Herald Gaborone. — Botswana’s capital city Gaborone has returned to normalcy after all the probable coronavirus cases registered last Friday tested negative, an official said on Monday. Mosepele Mosepele, deputy coordinator for the southern African country’s Covid-19 Presidential Taskforce Team, made the announcement during a virtual media briefing that was broadcast live on national television, Botswana Television. Mosepele said all the 16 possible cases, which were tested between Friday and Sunday, came out negative. “All the cases that caused Gaborone to be placed under lockdown were probable ones, which eventually tested negative, hence the decision to return to normalcy,” said Mosepele. Botswana’s capital city reinstated its strict containment measures starting midnight Friday following the announcement of presumed cases. Malaki Tshipayagae, director of public health in Botswana’s Ministry of Health and Wellness, said the lockdown ended at midnight on Monday. However, he urged the country’s citizens to exercise caution and all the precautionary measures put in place to mitigate the spread of the deadly disease. — Xinhua.
