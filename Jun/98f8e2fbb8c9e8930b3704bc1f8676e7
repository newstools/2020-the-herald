The Herald NEWCASTLE. — Aston Villa substitute Ahmed El Mohamady scored with seven minutes remaining to give his beleaguered side a potential lifeline from relegation as they claimed a point in a 1-1 Premier League draw at Newcastle United last night. Zimbabwe’s Marvelous Nakamba came in as a second half substitute. Villa remained in the bottom two but will be buoyed by their fightback at St James’ Park after substitute Dwight Gayle had put the home team in front in the 68th minute. Newcastle, who beat Sheffield United 3-0 on Sunday in their first game after the Covid-19 lockdown, stayed in 13th place as they advanced to 39 points from 31 games. Villa are on 27 points, having drawn two of three games played in a seven-day spell after the league’s return to action. Gayle had only been on for a minute when fellow replacement Andy Carroll provided a telling cross to allow him to score but El Mohamady steered home a glancing header from a corner in the 83rd minute to earn Villa a point. Villa had made a lively start but Mahmoud Trezeguet missed after ghosting in behind the defence and Mbwana Samatta failed to get enough power onto a good headed opportunity. — Reuters.
