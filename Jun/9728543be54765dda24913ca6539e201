The Herald LONDON. — Sadio Mane has sparked fears within Anfield that he could be ready to move out this summer. The £150million-rated Senegalese football star (28) has yet to offer any indication that he will sign a new deal offered him nine months ago. And boss Jurgen Klopp is growing anxious over the situation. He has told the Liverpool hierarchy that even if Mane is contracted until 2023 he wants a firm answer on whether is he prepared to commit for longer. Liverpool are on the point of tying down central defender Virgil Van Dijk to a new £250m contract that will run till 2025 as revealed by SunSport. He is expected to sign it once he and his side complete their march to the Premier League title with their season restarting in yesterday’s Merseyside derby. That would put him on £220 000 a week and make him the highest-paid player in the club’s history. Mane stands to make the same money if he puts pen to paper. But Real Madrid want him and he is also on Paris Saint-Germain’s radar. One possibility that is understood to being discussed within Liverpool is the possibility that Mane could figure in a swap deal plus £200m for French superstar Kylian Mbappe. The German’s priority, however, is to tie down Mane and move on with his plans for a major overhaul of his squad for the season to come. Klopp is determined to build on his success by adding major new names. But the name he would like to keep is Mane — and right now he is not sure if he can count on that. — The Sun.
