She immediately went to the farm and saw a group of people in her maize field. She rushed to Mvurwi police station who quickly dispatched some officers. When the officers arrived at the scene the thieves ran away in different directions, but they managed to arrest Vhonyera and Gomo. Lovemore was arrested after he ran to his homestead. Police officers followed him to his house and he tried to attack them with a machete. The police recovered two by 90 kg bags of maize in his house. In a separate case before the same magistrate, Obvious Muvezwa (29) of Muzarabani area under Chief Kasekete was sentenced to an effective four years in prison for stealing 40 sheep worth US$6 000 in Muzarabani.
