The Herald NEW YORK. – Kenya yesterday won the UN Security Council seat after beating its African rival Djibouti in second-round voting in New York. Kenya garnered 129 votes against Djibouti’s 62 in the voting that saw almost all member states vote. The president of UN General Assembly Tijjani Muhammad-Bande announced the winner after the voting exercise that took almost three hours. The contest between Kenya and Djibouti headed to the second round of voting after the first phase saw Nairobi’s victory insufficient to win the UN Security Council seat. In the first round on Wednesday, Nairobi scored 113 votes against Djibouti’s 78. The rules of the elections demand at least two-thirds of the eligible UN member states voting to be declared the winner. On Wednesday, the election saw 192 of the 193 member states voting. Only Venezuela was barred from casting its ballot as it is still in arrears for its membership in the UN. The UN Security Council is the most powerful organ of the UN, charged with maintaining global peace and security. Its decisions, by law, must be obeyed by all UN member states, giving its prestige and power. Kenya now is among the 10 non-permanent members. The Standard
