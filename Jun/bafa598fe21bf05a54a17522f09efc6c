The Herald LOS ANGELES. — Reigning Masters champion Tiger Woods and four-time major winner Brooks Koepka are among the exempt players for this year’s US Open announced on Thursday by the US Golf Association. Woods, a 15-time major champion, and Koepka, seeking a third consecutive PGA Championship victory in August, will join defending champion Gary Woodland among 11 US Open winners set to compete in the 120th US Open on September 17-20 at Winged Foot in Mamaroneck, New York. World number one Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, Britain’s Justin Rose and Germany’s Martin Kaymer will join fellow US Open winners Woods, Koepka, Woodland, Lucas Glover, Dustin Johnson, Webb Simpson and Jordan Spieth. The coronavirus pandemic forced a postponement of the US Open from its traditional June dates and wiped out all qualifying for the tournament, forcing the USGA to determine exempt categories for entry into the major championship. “The decision to cancel local and final qualifying for this year’s US Open was deeply disappointing, but we are pleased to still provide the world’s best professional and amateur players the opportunity to compete for this historic and coveted championship,” said USGA senior managing director of championships John Bodenhamer said. — AFP.
