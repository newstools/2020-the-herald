The Herald MANCHESTER. — Manchester City secured the first win of the English Premier League football’s restart with a 3-0 victory over a 10-man Arsenal at an empty Etihad on Wednesday night as the English top flight’s return was marked by protests against racial injustice. Both sets of players came together before kick-off to take a knee, as had Aston Villa and Sheffield United players in the first match after a 100-day stoppage due to coronavirus. “I’m embarrassed and ashamed of what the white people have done for the black people,” said City manager Pep Guardiola. “We have to do a lot of things for the black people which we have not done so far.” City’s victory closes the gap on Liverpool at the top to 22 points and means the Reds cannot secure the title when they face Everton in the Merseyside derby on Sunday. A minute’s silence before kick-off remembered those who had lost their lives to the coronavirus, including Guardiola’s mother. Black Lives Matter was also emblazoned on the back of shirts where the stars names are normally printed, as the players took a knee around the centre circle. There was little return to normality once the game did kick-off to the hollow ring of an empty stadium as a torrential downpour added to the difficult conditions for the players. “We expected it to be weird,” said City’s Raheem Sterling. “The first 10 minutes it was getting used to the atmosphere and getting the cobwebs off.” — AFP.
