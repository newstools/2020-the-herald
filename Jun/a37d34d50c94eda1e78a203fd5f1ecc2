The Herald LONDON. — West Indies players will wear the Black Lives Matter logo on their playing shirts when they face England throughout the upcoming Test cricket series. Cricket West Indies received permission to use the logo from Watford captain Troy Deeney, whose partner Alisha Hosannah created the design which includes a clenched fist of solidarity within a circle. The ICC-approved logo has appeared on the shirts of all 20 Premier League clubs since the competition resumed earlier this month. West Indies captain Jason Holder, who has voiced his support for the Black Lives Matter cause which has come to the forefront after the death of American George Floyd, said: “This is a pivotal moment in history for sports, for the game of cricket and for the West Indies cricket team. “We have come to England to retain the Wisden Trophy but we are very conscious of happenings around the world and the fight for justice and equality. We believe we have a duty to show solidarity and also to help raise awareness. “As a group of young men, we know of the rich and diverse history of West Indies cricket and we know we are guardians of the great game for generations to come.” Holder, who earlier this week called for racism to be treated like doping and corruption, said the players arrived at the decision to wear the logo after great consideration. “We did not take our decision lightly,” he added. “We know what it is for people to make judgements because of the colour of our skin, so we know what it feels like, this goes beyond the boundary. There must be equality and there must be unity. Until we get that as people, we cannot stop.  — Sky Sports.
