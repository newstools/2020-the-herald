THE High Court has declared businessman Mr Kevin Magwaza the legitimate proprietor of the gold-rich Etna Mine in Kadoma, putting to rest long-drawn squabbles over control of the mine. Justice Edith Mushore fined the rival miner Mr Spencer Tshuma $250 000 for contempt of court after he disobeyed court orders. Failure to pay the fine, Mr Tshuma risks serving 90 days in prison. Mr Tshuma and other people claiming ownership through him, were evicted from Etna Mine. The applicant (Mr Magwaza) is entitled to exercise exclusive mining rights in relation to the mining location at Kadoma known as Etna Mine, situated at Etna Estates, Kadoma under registration number 16014. “The first respondent (Mr Tshuma) and all those claiming rights to mine, use and occupation through him be and are hereby ordered to forthwith vacate from the mining location. . . “In consequence of such contempt, respondent is fined a sum of RTGS$250 000 for contempt of court which shall be deposited with the Registrar of this court,” ruled Justice Mushore. The judge said filing of an appeal at the Supreme Court will not suspend the current order of the High Court. Harare lawyer Mr Itai Ndudzo of Mutamangira and Associates and Advocate Method Ndlovu represented Mr Magwaza.
