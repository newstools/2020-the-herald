The Herald Sports Reporter THE ZIFA Sports Medicine and the Premier Soccer League medical committees are today expected to come up with their guidelines on how football in the country can resume. Edward Chagonda heads both the association’s medical committee and the newly-set-up PSL medical committee. The committee includes Doctors Nicholas Munyonga, Soneni Moyo, Mtokhozisi Moyo and Mutare-based physiotherapist Chido Pfumojena. “We are happy that CAF has given us a framework with a 27-page document. We have already prepared ours, a 19-page document, which is a local football guideline,’’ Chagonda said. “These things are done at national level as national guidelines from the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, working together with the Ministry of Sport as well as the Sports and Recreation Commission. “Then, we do a specific guideline for football which we will sit down tomorrow (today) via a zoom meeting with the ZIFA competitions committee and the Premier Soccer League and agree and then give it out to the clubs.’’ Some of the interesting pointers highlighted in the CAF recovery plan are the living and working conditions of players. According to CAF, the associations must first ensure the player’s salary situation is favourable for any resumption of training and competitive activities. The associations are also expected to offer psychological assistance to teams and players affected.
