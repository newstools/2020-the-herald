The Herald LONDON. — Ben Stokes says he is ready to lead England in the absence of Joe Root in the upcoming Test cricket series against the West Indies. Root is expected to miss at least one of the three Tests against the Caribbean side as his wife is due to give birth to the couple’s second child. As the official Test vice-captain, all-rounder Stokes is ready step into the main leadership role despite concerns being expressed about the extra workload it will put on him. Referencing basketball legend Michael Jordan, whose Chicago Bulls team of the 1990s was the subject the ESPN documentary “The Last Dance”, and team-mate Scott Pippen, Stokes said he would be aiming to lead his country after the example set by Root. Stokes wrote in his Mirror column: “There is a chance our skipper Joe Root may miss a Test this summer because he and his wife are expecting their second child. “I’m the Scottie Pippen to Joe’s Michael Jordan. It is his team. But what would be the point of asking me to do the job if not for this kind of situation? “I understand where Joe is taking the team and how he wants to lead it. “So although I’ll make my own calls on the field and do the job as I see it as the game evolves, everything else will very much be the same as when Joe is there.” The first Test against the Windies is scheduled to start on July 8 at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton and Stokes is pleased cricket will be played again. The sport has been put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic. — AFP.
